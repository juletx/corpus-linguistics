# Corpus Linguistics

This course is an introduction to corpus linguistics. We will start with a brief introduction to textual corpora, including linguistic annotation and representation schemas. We will then address aspects such as the extraction of relevant information from corpora, such as collocations or keyword extraction, using statistical and distributional techniques. Finally, we will learn the XML markup language. During the module we will introduce several corpora in various languages (English, Spanish, Basque, etc).
