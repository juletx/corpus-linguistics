Proton
mulls
ASEAN
/
China
car
project
DRB
-
Hicom
is
considering
initiating
a
car
project
for
the
Association
of
Southeast
Asian
Nations
(
ASEAN
)
plus
China
,
in
which
Proton
will
be
a
key
component
,
with
potential
partnerships
between
Malaysia
,
Thailand
,
Indonesia
,
and
China
,
reports

"

"
said
Datuk
Seri
Mohd
Khamil
Jamil
,
DRB
-
Hicom
Group
's
managing_director
.
Significance
:
In
January
last
year
,
DRB
-
Hicom
bought
Khazanah
Nasional
's
42.7
%
stake
in
Proton
for
1.29
billion
ringgits
(
USD423.7
million
)
and
subsequently
took_over
the
company
in
May
for
MYR3
billion
.
The
group
is
to
come_up
with
a
turnaround
strategy
for
Proton
by
March
(
seeMalaysia
:
12
December
2012
:
)
.
DRB
-
Hicom
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
buying
Proton
was
to
help
develop
the
automaker
's
presence
in
the
regional
market
as
an
ASEAN
carmaker
.
The
planned
car
project
would
be
marketed
under
the
Volkswagen
-
DRB
-
Hicom
joint-venture
banner
.
Meanwhile
,
Proton
is
optimistic
that
the
turnaround
plan
for
its
Lotus
unit
can
be
completed
in
the
next
two
years
.
The
company
has
received
20
orders
for
Lotus
cars
in
the
local
market
and
has
delivered
12
.
Proton
is
looking_at
yearly
sales
of
between
100
and
200
units
of
Lotus
cars
upon
its
entry
into
Malaysia
.
Globally
,
it
is
looking_at
sales
of
between
3,000
and
4,000
units
in
the
financial_year
ending
March
2015
.
The
biggest
markets
for

Isuzu
,
GM
to
begin
talks
on
joint
pick-up
truck
development
Isuzu
Motors
and
General
Motors
(
GM
)
said
in
separate
statements
today
(
10
January
)
that
they
have
agreed
to
start
talks
on
the
joint
development
of
pick-up
trucks
in
a
bid
to
cut
development
costs
,
reports
Reuters
.
The
companies
said
they
had
signed
a
memorandum
of
understanding
to
start
negotiations
but
declined
to
outline
the
timing
of
the
talks
or
any
other
aspect
of
the
potential
deal
.
Japan
'sNikkeibusiness
daily
reports
that
the
deal
,
which
will
also
include
co-management
of
the
pick-up
truck
business
,
will
be
formalised
later
this
month
in
a
meeting
between
Isuzu
president
Susumu
Hosoi
and
GM
CEO
Dan
Akerson
.
The
newspaper
also
claims
that
the
two
companies
will
continue
talks
on
the
possibility
of
GM
once
again
taking
a
stake
in
Isuzu
,
but
this
has
been
categorically
denied
by
an
Isuzu
spokesperson
.
Significance
:
GM
and
Isuzu
last
came_together
in
1971
to
form
a
capital
and
technical
alliance
that
lasted
35
years
.
After
taking
a
49
%
stake
in
Isuzu
in
1999
,
a
financially
desperate
GM
had
to
sell
all
of
its
holding
in
the
company
in
2006
and
filed
for
bankruptcy
in
2009
,
allowing
Toyota
to
buy
a
5.9
%
stake
in
Isuzu
immediately
following
the
dissolution
.
However
,
GM
and
Isuzu
have
since
continued
their
co-operation
in
some
areas
,
including
joint
development
of
the
new
Isuzu
D
-
Max
pick-up
in
2011
and
joint
sales
in
Latin
America
and
South
Africa
.
In
April
last
year
,
GM
informally
proposed
acquiring
a
stake
of
around
10
%
in
Isuzu
(
seeJapan
-
United
States
:
30
April
2012
:
)
.
However
,
the
deal
did
not
go_through
owing
to
Isuzu
's
reluctance
,
which
still
persists
.
GM
is
believed
to
be
eager
to
tap
into
Isuzu
's
presence
in
Southeast
Asian
markets
and
its
diesel
technology
,
which
could
help
it
protect
market
share
in
its
core
North_American
pick-up
truck
market
,
where
Ford
is
snapping_at
its
heels
.
For
Isuzu
,
a
partnership
with
GM
would
enable
it
to
lower
the
cost
burden
associated
with
the
development
of
green
technologies
.

Significance
:
The
Jeep

one
of
the
primary
reasons
for
Fiat
acquiring
the
bankrupt
company
(

.
Achieving
the
800,000
sales
mark
by

is
important
for
Jeep
to
be
able
to
re-invest
in

.
As

Detroit

The
trust_fund
overseeing
benefits
for
Chrysler
's
UAW
retirees
is
trying
to
force
the
automaker
to
register
16.6
%
of
its
stock
for_sale
to
investors
to
establish
how
much
the
shares
are
worth
.
This
could
lead
to
an
initial_public_offering
of
Chrysler
shares
to
investors
for
the
first
time
since
1998
.
The
registration
also
could
help
resolve
a
lawsuit
between
Fiat
,
which
owns
58.5
%
of
Chrysler
,
and
the
UAW
Retiree
Medical
Benefits
Trust
over
the
value
of
Chrysler
's
shares
.
"
All
it
does
is
it
gives
(
the
trust
)
some
bargaining
leverage
as
to
what
the
valuation
of
this
company
is
right
now
,
"
said
Richard
Hilgert
,
an
auto
analyst
at
Chicago-based
Morningstar
.
The
UAW
trust
owns
the
remaining
41.5
%
of
Chrysler
.
Fiat
sued
the
UAW
trust
in
Delaware
Chancery
Court
in
September
.
The
trust
,
also_known_as
a
Voluntary
Employee
Beneficiary
Association
(
VEBA
)
,
is
under
financial
pressure
to
get
the
highest
possible
value
for
its
shares
.
Fiat
,
in
the
middle
of
a
costly
reorganization
in
Europe
,
doesn
't
want
to
overpay
.
In
2009
,
the
trust
accepted
shares
of
Chrysler
stock
as
part
of
the
automaker
's
reorganization
plan
and
exit
from
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
with
Fiat
as
its
controlling
shareholder
.
On
Wednesday
,
both
Chrysler
and
Fiat
said
they
would
comply
with
obligations
of
the
Chrysler
ownership
agreement
from
2009
,
but
neither
committed
to
a
public
stock
sale
.
Chrysler
and
Fiat
CEO
Sergio
Marchionne
has
said
Fiat
wants
to
own
all
of
Chrysler
eventually
.
In
July
,
Fiat
notified
the
trust
that
it
wanted
to
purchase
the
first
3.3
%
of
the
shares
at
issue
,
offering
$
155
million
for
54,154
Chrysler
shares
,
under
a
complicated
formula
that
includes
the
most
recent
four
quarters
of
net_income
.
The
UAW
trust
,
in
a
legal
filing
,
argued
that
the
shares
were
worth
about
$
381
million
,
and
has
refused
to
sell
at
the
price
Fiat
offered
.
Hilgert
said
Fiat
's
offer
implies
a
total
value
for
Chrysler
of
$
4.2
billion
compared
with
the
UAW
trust
's
estimated
value
of
$
10.3
billion
.
Hilgert
,
however
,
estimates
that
Chrysler
's
total
stock
could
be
worth
about
$
13.5
billion
.
The
UAW
trust
's
stock-registration
demand
also

German
BMW
car
group
has
sold
more
cars
than
ever
before
in
its
history
.
In
2012
,
the
carmaker
's
core
BMW
brand
remained
in
top
position
in
the
global
luxury
car
market
,
ahead
of
its
two
strongest
German
rivals
.
BMW
sold
1.84
million
vehicles
in
2012
,
surpassing
its
previous
sales
record
set_in
2011
by
about
176,000
units
,
the
Munich-based
car
group
announced
Thursday
.
In
December
alone
it
sold
about
181,000
cars
,
which
represented
a
rise
of
about
14
percent
year-on-year
,
BMW
said
.
Demand
was
especially
strong
in
markets
in
China
and
the
United
States
,
which
drove
sales
of
the
group
's
flagship
BMW
luxury
brand
to
a
record
1.54
million
units
.
Top-of-the-range
Rolls

,
which
alongside
the
compact
Mini
is
also
part
of
the
group
,
added
3,575
cars
to
the
result
-
the
highest
figure
in
the
carmaker
's
108-year
history
.
"
We

ahead
of
German
automakers
Audi
and

.
The
two
runners-up
also
presented
record
sales
figures
for
2012
,
with
Volkswagen
subsidiary
Audi
posting
even
stronger
growth
than
BMW
,
as
sales
grew
11.7
percent
to
1.46

in

the

Last

An
auto
industry_analyst
has
said
that
Chrysler
Group
LLC
,
which
is
majority
owned
by
Italy
's
Fiat
SpA
,
could
be
worth
as
much_as
$
13.5
billion
just
three
years
after
the
company
filed
for
bankruptcy
.
The
valuation
issue
has
come_up
because
Fiat
and
a
United
Auto
Workers
(
UAW
)
union
trust_fund
that
owns
41.5
%
of
the
company
are
in
a
dispute
over
an
IPO
for
the
now-healthy
company
.
The
Wall
Street
Journal
reports
[
1
]
that
the
UAW
Retiree
Medical
Benefits
Trust
wants
Chrysler
to
register
16.6
%
of
its
shares
for
a
public
offering
.
The
UAW
's
demand
was
part
of
the
2009
agreement
that
led
to
Chrysler
's
emergence
from
bankruptcy
.
Fiat
is
trying
to
accumulate
more
shares
of
Chrysler
as
a
step
toward
a
full
merger
of
the
two
companies
.
Last
year
the
Italian
firm
exercised
a
call_option
on
an
additional
3.3
%
stake
in
Chrysler
,
which
cost
Fiat
just
$
139.7
million
.
The
union
trust
sought
$
343
million
,
which
would
have
valued
Chrysler
at
about
$
10.4
billion
instead
of
the
$
4.2
billion
valuation
based
on
Fiat
's
purchase_price
.
Now
Fiat
wants
to
exercise
a
second
call_option
for
another
3.3
%
stake
at
a
proposed
price
of
$
198
million
,
valuing
Chrysler
at
about
$
6
billion
.
The
union
probably
doesn
't
really
care
much
one
way
or
the
other
about
an
IPO
,
but
it
certainly
must
hate
having
to
sell
parts
of
its
stake
in
Chrysler
for
what
it
believes
are
cut-rate
prices
.

with
a

record
of
1.54

,
BMW
focuses_on
luxury
end

Top
German
luxury

much

marked
only

of
0.8

,
BMW

,
United

Nuclear
Iran
(
UANI
)
applauded
both
Maserati
and
Lamborghini
for
ending
their
business_activities
in
Iran
.
UANI
will
also
now
list
Maserati
's
parent
company
,
Fiat
,
as
having
fully
pulled_out
of
Iran
.
Last
October
,
UANI
,
New
York
City
Public
Advocate
Bill
de
Blasio
,
and
Iran180
held
a
press_conference
in_front
of
Maserati
's
Manhattan
showroom
,
and
called_on
both
companies
to
put
an
end
to
their
import
agreements
with
Iranian
entities
and
close
any
dealerships
or
showrooms
in
Iran
.
Following
that
event
,
UANI
and
the
Public
Advocate
's
office
entered
into
discussions
with
both
Lamborghini
and
Maserati
.
In
those
discussions
,
Lamborghini
stated
that
it
and
its
subsidiaries
have
put
an
end
to
"
any
interest
,
negotiations
or
established
relationships
regarding
operations
of
any
type
in
Iran
.
"
Separately
,
Maserati
and
Fiat
executives
pledged
that
Maserati
has
"
ended
[
its
]
discussions
with
a
potential
vehicle
importer
and
distributor
"
in
Iran
,
the
Arta
Group
.
Maserati
stated
that
it
had
,
at
the
request
of
UANI
and
the
Public
Advocate
,
"
threatened
legal_action
"
against
that
group
to
stop
using
its
name
.
Maserati
also
stated
that
it
has
"
successfully
worked
with
Facebook
to
disable
an
Arta
Group
site
which
falsely
suggested
a
Maserati
presence
in
Iran
.
"
UANI
has
updated
its
Auto
Campaign
and
Luxury
Goods
Campaign
webpages
to
reflect
these
developments
.
Said
UANI
CEO
,
Ambassador
Mark
D.
Wallace
:
We
are
satisfied
with
the
pledges
we
have
received
from
both
Lamborghini
and
Maserati
,
and
we
applaud
both
for
their
responsible
action
.
Given
Maserati
's
commitment
,
we
are
now
able
to
list
Fiat
as
having
fully
ended
its
business
in
Iran
.
We
are
pleased
to
bring
our
Fiat
campaign
to
a
successful
end
.
This
campaign
proved
once
again
that
when
a
company
is
forced
to
choose
between
the
Iranian
market
and
the
U.
S.
market
,
it
will
leave
Iran
.
We
will
continue
to
work
with
the
Public
Advocate
,
to
pressure
more
and
more
businesses
to
pull_out
of
Iran
and
continue
isolating
the
Iranian
regime
.
Said
de
Blasio
:
This
is
one
more
step_in
the
right
direction
in
a
crucial
campaign
to
hit
the
Iranian
regime
at
its
economic
core
.
Maserati
and
Lamborghini
have
done
the
right
thing
in
pulling
their
business
from
Iran
-
and
I
am
pleased
we
can
remove
them
from
Iranwatchlist.com
.
This
is
also
a
strong
message
to
New
Yorkers
and
Americans
:
we
as
consumers
can
help
fight
against
a
nuclear
Iran
,
and
I
plan
to
continue
this
fight
relentlessly
,
with
as
many
allies
as
we
can
assemble
.
Said
Iran180
Executive
Director
,
Chris
DeVito
:
We
are
pleased
that
Maserati
has
taken
proactive
steps
to
ensure
that
its
vehicles
,
and
its
brand
,
are
no
longer
appearing
in
car
showrooms
in
Tehran
.
While
we
applaud
this
step_forward
,
it
's
important
that
we
don
't
lose_sight_of
the
fact
that
several
large
automobile
manufacturers
continue
to
conduct
business
in
the
country
.
We
will
continue
to
work
with
the
Public
Advocate
and
United
Against
Nuclear
Iran
until
every
major
international
auto_maker
realizes
that
doing
business
that
benefits
the
Iranian
regime
is
a
dead_end
.
UANI
's
campaign
against
Fiat
began
in
2011
,
and
included
advertisements
in
New
York
newspapers
[
see
additional
ad

]
,
and
a
protest
at
the
New
York
International
Auto

.
UANI
also
ran
a
public
campaign
in
2012
regarding
entertainer
Jennifer
Lopez
's
endorsements
of
Fiat
,
and
produced
an
online
video

announced
that

end
certain
business
in
Iran
,
including
the
sale
of
Iveco
trucks
that
have
been
used
by
the
Iranian

.
UANI
applauded
Fiat
,
but
called_on
it
to
take
additional
action
,
specifically
regarding
reports
of
a
Maserati
showroom
in
Tehran
.
Maserati
,
Lamborghini
,
and
Fiat
join
Hyundai
,

,
and
Kia
in
pulling_out
of

in
the
past
year
.
In

2012
,
Ambassador
Wallace
testified
about
Iran
's
automotive
industry
before
the
U.

House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
.
UANI
has
developed
model
legislation
,
the

Act
,
to
require

The

implementation
of

Reputation
counts
for
a_lot
if
you
want
your
new
car
to
retain
its
value
THERE
was
good
news
for
the
motor
industry
this
New_Year
,
with
figures
showing
that
new
car
sales
for
2012
rose
5.3
per
cent
to
2,044,609
,
thanks
to
high
demand
from
consumers
.
It
's
the
highest
annual
volume
since
2008
and
the
largest
percentage
increase
since
2001
.
Despite
sales
being
14.9
per
cent
below
2007
levels
,
the
Society
of
Motor
Manufacturers
and
Traders
(
SMMT
)
figures
show
,
the
year
nevertheless
ended_on
an
optimistic
note
,
with
sales
in
December
3.7
per
cent
up
on
the
same
month
in
2011
.
The
SMMT
believes
the
market
will
"
hold_firm
"
this
year
,
and
chief_executive
Paul
Everitt
says
that
new
cars
'
lower
running
costs
are
encouraging
people
to
buy
,
perhaps
reflected
in
the
best-sellers
,
headed
by
the
Ford
Fiesta
,
followed
by
Vauxhall
's
Corsa
,
the
Ford
Focus
,
Vauxhall
Astra
and
VW
Golf
.
Low
running
costs
are
important
,
of_course
.
But
what
may
prove
equally
as
important
to
consumers
is
the
price
they
get
for
their
once-new
car
when
they
sell
it
on
.
There
's
little
merit
in
telling
potential
buyers
that
your
car
is
highly
economical
,
for_instance
,
if
your
particular
model
just
doesn
't
have
a
great
image
,
as
a
new
survey
from
Glass
's
Guide
demonstrates
.
Their
experts
examined
car
values
or
"
residuals
"
for
2012
and
came_up
with
a
list
of
the
top
10
that
best
held
onto
their
value
.
At
the
top
of
the
chart
is
the
Toyota
Land
Cruiser
4.5
D-4D
auto
which
,
at
three_years_old
and
with
an
average
of
37,000
miles
on
the
clock
,
retained
73
per
cent
of
its
original
cost
.
In
second
place
is
the
Audi
Q5
2.0
TDI
(
141bhp
)
Quattro
SE
,
holding
73.2
per
cent
of
its
value
,
followed
by
the
Skoda
Yeti
2.0
TDI
CR
4X4
140bhp
Elegance
,
at
72.5
per
cent.
Other
high-retainers
included
the
Land
Rover
Discovery
4
3.0
TD
(
67
per
cent
)
,
Land
Rover
Range
Rover
Sport
3.0
TD
and
Volkswagen
Scirocco
2.0
TSI
(
both
66
per
cent
)
and
the
Audi
Q7
3.6
FSI
V6
(
64
per
cent
)
.
Good
news
for
Londoners
,
who
love
the
Fiat
500
,
is
that
the
1.2
Sport
version
also
made
the
list
,
holding
64
per
cent
of
its
value
,
along
with
the
Porsche
Cayenne
3.0
TDI
V6
(
64
per
cent
)
and
Volkswagen
Golf
2.0
TSI
(
63.5
per
cent
)
.
"
When
buying
a
new
car
it
can
be
disheartening
to
see
how
much
of
its
value
is
lost
within
the
first
few
years
of
ownership
,
"
says
Glass
's
.
"
And
while
all
cars
lose
a
significant
proportion
of
their
value
,
some
lose
considerably
more
than
others
.
So
,
with
a_bit
of
savvy
buying
,
your
car
may
hold
far
more
of
its
value
than
you
expect
.
"
While
there
's
no
guarantee
the
same
cars
will
hold
onto
their
value
in
exactly
the
same
way
this
year
,
Glass
's
say
that
if
they
get_into
the
top
10
one
year
,
they
will
probably
do_well
the
following
year
.
So
what
are
the
golden_rules
?
If
you
wish
to
maximise
the
residual
value
of
your
car
,
examine
sales
values
of
used
cars
,
over
time
,
to
see
which
depreciate
most
.
One
way
is
to
log
onto
glass.co.uk
and
use
its
free
valuation
service
.
Also
,
more
economical
engines
,
often
hold
their
value
better
,
so
don
't
buy
a
gas-guzzler
.
Glass
's
says
it
's
no
coincidence
that
six
of
the
top
10
entries
are
powered
by
diesel
.
It
may
therefore
seem
strange
that
high-powered
,
sporty
versions
of
the
VW
Scirocco
and
Golf
make
the
list
,
but
these
are
more
specialist
cars
,
built_in
small
numbers
,
keeping
demand
and
value
up
.
"
There
are
a_few
interesting
points
to
note
,
"
says
Adrian
Rushmore
,
Glass
's
managing_editor
.
"
We
usually
see
models
that
are
only
appearing
as
threeyear-old
examples
for
the
first
time
,
because
they
are
then
at
the
height
of
their
desirability
in
the
mix
of
all
threeyear-old
cars
being
offered
.
The
key
out-take
is
that
cars
that
hold
the
most
value
are
those
with
a
strong
image
.

Ford
also
is
doubling
its
quarterly
dividend
to
10
cents
per
share
,
payable
March
1
,
a
move
that
pleased
investors
who
pushed
Ford
shares
to
$
13.83
,
its
highest
closing_price
since
July
8
,
2011
.
The
dividend
hike
may
indicate
Ford
is
confident
that
it
won
't
disappoint
investors
when
it
releases
fourth-quarter
earnings
later
this
month
.
Those
figures
will
be
used
to
calculate
profit-sharing
for
hourly
workers
and
bonuses
for
salaried
workers
,
usually
paid
in
March
.
Last
year
,
40,600
UAW
workers
received
average
profit-sharing
of
$
5,000
.
Last
year
,
about
20,000
salaried
workers
received
both
bonuses
and
raises
for
the
first
time
since
2008
.
Ford
shed
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
beginning
in
the
middle
of
last
decade
and
through
the
financial
crisis
of
2008
and
2009
.
New
car
sales
in
the
U.
S.
rose
13.4
percent
,
to
14.49
million
in
2012
.
Last
year
,
Ford
created
more_than
8,100
salaried
and
hourly
jobs
in
the
U.

About
1,000
of
those
represented
work
brought_back
to

factories
previously
done_by
suppliers
in
Japan

.
As
part
of
the
2011
UAW
contract
,
Ford
pledged
to
add
12,000
hourly
jobs
and
invest
$
6.2
billion
in
U.

plants
by
2015

Ford
lost
market
share
in
2012
because
it
could
not
make
enough
cars
and
trucks
and
because
Toyota
and
Honda
regained
sales
they
lost
in

.
Last
year
,
Ford
began
adding
equipment
and
workers
to
boost
North_American
production
by
400,000

year
.
The
expansions
and
launches
of
such
models
as
the
Ford
Fusion
,
Escape
,
Focus
and
C

kept
Jim
Tetreault
,
vice_president

manufacturing
,
hopping
.
"
It
was
the
most
launches
and
capacity
adds
in
a
year
that
I
have
ever
had
in

career

Tetreault

This

,
Ford
is
rolling_out
the
Fiesta

The

Hiking
the
dividend
comes_about
one
year
after
Ford
resumed
paying
anything
to
shareholders
after
having
suspended
the
dividend
for
five
years
.
From
2006
through
2011
,
Ford
took_on
massive
debt
to
weather
the
worst
economic_crisis
since
the
Great
Depression
.
That
debt
was
rated
as
"
junk
,
"
or
below
investment
grade
,
meaning
the
company
had
to
pay
higher
interest_rates
on
bonds
.
The
aggressive
borrowing
allowed
Ford
to
survive
without
the
same
government
assistance
that
the
Obama
administration
provided
General
Motors
and
Chrysler
in
2009
.
Peter
Nesvold
,
equity
analyst
with
Jefferies
&
Co.
in
New
York
,
said
the
dividend
increase
is
a
positive
signal
that
Ford
's
restructuring
of
its
unprofitable
European
business
is
having
an
impact
.
Nesvold
raised
his
target
price
of
Ford
's
stock
to
$
16
.
Ford
is
closing
plants
,
consolidating
manufacturing
and
reducing
workers
in
Europe
,
where
it
lost
slightly
more_than
$
1

in

nine
months
of

BMW
head

Ian
Robertson
said
in
a
release
.
BMW
beat
its
rivals
in
2012
as
the
world
's
top-selling
luxury
automaker
with
a
new
sales
record
of
1.54
million
BMW
brand
vehicles
thanks
to
strong
demand
for
its
1-series
and
3-series
.
Taking_into_account
of
MINI
and
Rolls
-
Royce
,
BMW
global
sales
posted
an
11
percent
year-on-year
increase
and
reached
a
record
1.85
million
vehicles
,
according
to
Automotive
News
Europe
.
Unlike
its
competitors
who
face
slack
demand
and
capacity
cut
,
BMW
focuses_on
luxury
end
of
the
market
,
which
is
less
affected
by
recession
and
yields
higher
profit
.
BMW
was
followed
by
Audi

the
Volkswagen
Group
subsidiary
,
with
global
annual
sales
of
1.45

a
4.7

.
Top
German
luxury
brand
's
record
sales
owed
much
to
strong
demands
in
North
America
and
Asia
,
especially
China
.
For_instance
,
BMW
sales
in
Europe
marked
only
a
small
increase
of
0.8
percent
in
the
first
nine
months
of
2012

However
,
BMW
sales
in
China
during
the
nine-month
period
surged
by
33.3
percent
to
237,650

The
Munich-based
firm
reportedly
plans
to
increase
sales
in
China
by
more

10
percent
in
