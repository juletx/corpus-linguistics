In American romance almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called meeting cute that is boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom Just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts but he said simultaneously I wish they were emeralds Aside from the comico-romantico content here a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on
The way MacArthur said his line if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist would probably have gone like this Af Primary stresses on emeralds and wish note pitch 3 pretty high on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl one degree of oversoftness Conclusions The people involved and subsequent facts bear me out here knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds both monetary and sentimental And the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture
In other words like automation machines designed to work in tandem they shared the same programming a mutual understanding not only of English words but of the four stresses pitches and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white At this point unfortunately romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture but consider if you can bear it what might have happened if MacArthur for some perverse undaunted reason had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber The point quite simply is this words they might have had but communication no
This basic principle the first in a richly knotted bundle was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith Jr. at the University of Buffalo where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics A brisk amusing man apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young rat named Arthur who never could make up his mind Later he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute It was there in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts that he first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication
To the trained ear of the linguist talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker such things as geographical origin and/or history socio-economic identity education It is only fairly recently however that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people This for obvious reasons makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy
In the early 1950's Smith together with his distinguished colleague George Trager so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell Ray agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication 1 words or language 2 paralanguage a set of phenomena including laughing weeping voice breaks and tone of voice and 3 kinesics the technical name for gestures facial expressions and body shifts nodding or shaking the head talking with one's hands et cetera
Smith's first workout with stresses pitches and junctures was based on mother which spells in our culture a good deal more than bread alone For example if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother The usual U.S. norm would be Af Middle pitches slight pause juncture before mother slight rise at the end The symbols of mother's status here are all usual for culture U.S.A. Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style Af Note the drop to pitch 1 the lowest on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence this is a fade ending and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech expressing something less than conventional respect for mother Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with Af In other words the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated And while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp With this seven-word sentence though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food he was telling things about himself and in the last two examples revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture
The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established in point of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training Some of the earliest recordings made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which if they were at all discernible in print were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts In a general way psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words
At a minimum recording usually on tape which is now in wide professional use brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue the note of disapproval ambivalence or ambiguity annoyance resentment and the disinclination to speak at all this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences
Interpretation naturally remains the role of the therapist but orientation not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people can be considerably beefed up by the linguist His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient In one now-historic first interview for example the transcript reproduced from the book The First Five Minutes goes like this The therapist's level tone is bland and neutral he has for example avoided stressing you which would imply disapproval or surprise which would set the patient apart from other people The patient on the other hand is far from neutral aside from her specifically regional accent she reveals by the use of the triad irritable tense depressed a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language i.e. she must have had at least a high-school education and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before Then she catapults into everything and everybody putting particular violence on everybody indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag that is it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point Consequently it is referred to the therapist for attention He may then very well conclude that everybody is probably not the true target of her resentment Immediately thereafter the patient fractures her rehearsed story veering into an oversoft breathy sloppily articulated I feel like talking right now
Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the woman's husband She says later but still within the opening five minutes I keep thinking of a divorce but another emotional death
The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce By saying another emotional death she reveals that there has been a previous one although she has not described it in words This the therapist may pursue in later questioning The phrase emotional death interesting and to a non-scientific mind rather touching suggests that this woman may have some flair for words perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called creative
Since the psychiatric interview like any other interview depends on communication it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience His own communication apparatus operated superbly and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman Interestingly enough although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman when groups of them began playing back interviews they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques almost everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again
Yet in spite of this intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that in the first five minutes of an initial interview the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just wrong with him to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen Naturally the patient does not say I hate my father or Sibling rivalry is what bugs me What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved Some of the classic indicators as described by Drs. Pittenger Hockett and Danehy in The First Five Minutes are these ambiguity of pronouns Stammering or repetition of I you he she et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty On the other hand significant facts may be concealed she may mean I or everybody as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before may refer to a specific person The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives When someone says for example They took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made This patient in actuality was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet stammered when he spoke of his wife which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship

She was just another freighter from the States and she seemed as commonplace as her name She was the John Harvey one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans bombs and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943
The John Harvey arrived in Bari a port on the Adriatic on November 28th making for Porto Nuovo which as the name indicates was the ancient city's new and modern harbor Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole If anyone thought of the John Harvey it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried
Which was poison gas
It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons
Throughout the early years of World War 2 reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas Germany in Russia Japan in China again They were always denied Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first To silence extremists to warn the Axis President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August
From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare I have been loath to believe that any nation even our present enemies could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons
However evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources
Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind This country has not used them and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies
The following month the invasion of Italy was begun and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy Bari was chosen as a depot not only for its seeming safety but because of its proximity to airfields Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne It would be made in three waves the first to lay down a smokescreen the second to drop the gas bombs the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below
So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson the Cargo Security Officer Secrecy was paramount Only a few other people very important people knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks No one else must know Thus in the immemorial way in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not was the stage set for tragedy at Bari
It was the night of December 2 1943 and it was growing dark in Bari It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German Me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit Capt. A. B. Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very worried He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy On November 24th they had made a raid on La Maddalena Two days later some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off Bougie sinking a troopship and it had been that very night that the Me-210 had made its first appearance After it had reappeared the next two nights Jenks went to higher headquarters and said
For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic
But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz the commander who would conduct the Little Blitz on London in 1944 a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously True there had been raids on Naples but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast No Bari was out of range More than that Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him For Jenks knew that Bari's defenses were made of paper The Royal Air Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available There were no R.A.F. fighter squadrons on Bari airfield The radar station with the best location was still not serviceable Telephone communication was bad And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster multiple command
It had been made shockingly evident that very morning to Ensign Kay K. Vesole in charge of the armed guard aboard the John Bascom A British officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers
This harbor is a bomber's paradise the Britisher had said with frank grimness up to you to protect yourselves We expect any help from the fighters at Foggia either all being used on offensive missions
Vesole had been stunned Not fire until the bombs came down He thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head Like hell Like hell wait and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out What would his guns guide on then the North Star Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs and when night began to fall he put Seaman 2/c Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette Below decks Seaman 1/c Stanley Bishop had begun to write a letter home
Above decks on the John Harvey Lieutenant Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy There were lights glinting in the city too even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible Bari was asking for it he thought
For five days now they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded He hoped they would put in somewhere way way down in the earth The burden of his secret was pressing down on him as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs They seemed happy at the delay in unloading glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as Bari Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had been the first to leave Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade
The other half of the crew plus Beckstrom and his men had remained aboard Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly Damned if that a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor Porto Vecchio The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver and he glanced upward His eyes boggled
It was a clear night and it was raining
Capt. Michael A. Musmanno Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula had also seen and felt the rain But he had mistaken it for bugs
Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population Musmanno was on deck At exactly 7:30 he felt a fluttering object brush his face He snatched at it savagely He turned the beam of his flashlight on it He laughed It was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating He frowned But how could Another longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth It was two feet long It was not candy wrapping
It was window the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers
Fermate Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen Stop Stop the engines
Unsinkable slowed and stopped hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at Bari
They had come from airports in the Balkans these hundred-odd Junkers 88's They had winged over the Adriatic they had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her attacking with deadly skill They had ruined the radar warning system with their window they had made themselves invisible above their flares And they also had the lights of the city the port wall lanterns and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on After the first two were blacked out the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British MP's shot it out
In that interval the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor
Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud were impossible to miss The little Unsinkable sank almost immediately Captain Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under
John Bascom went down early too Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly but they had no targets Most of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs Vesole rushed from gun to gun attempting to direct fire He was wounded but fought on Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One Three and Five Now the Bascom was mortally wounded Luckily she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt
The order to abandon ship was given but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks

There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you wondering why you are staring open-mouthed in amazement You explain I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before I tell when but positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past
This experience will have happened to many of you
Emerson in his lecture refers to the startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before whether dreaming or waking a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room and heard precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue already seen illusion just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually
When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance of deja vue except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude
One day Maeterlinck coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified
Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the jargon of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered how or why had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself
One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone clasping him by the arm whispered I want a word with you please At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier
Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts However readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams Chapter 1 As a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case and what is more every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams
Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy clairvoyance prevision and retrovision The basic mystery of dreams which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream is in the fact that they are original visual continuities
I recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence so complete in detail from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen And when psychology explains glibly but the subconscious mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind
Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence
The question becomes What is a dream
Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie
Every dream and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available In most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects But these are dreamed in original action in some particular continuity which we remember having seen in real life For instance the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and with photographic realism sees Smith driving the car whereas it is a matter of fact that Smith drive a car There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams
The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support A mental image subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought or consciously in light sleep is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream but within the depths of the fourth dimension
Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components including that weird feeling of deja vue inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem
As in the theory of perception established in psycho-physiology the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain The opening paragraph of the chapter titled The Theory Of Representative Perception in the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger says passed on to the brain and there by some unexplained process it causes the mind to have a perception
But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves between the inner brain and the eyes carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location Hereby the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen not the retinal image the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers motor tensions associated word symbols and consciousness
Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy We know that the number of radio and television impulses sound waves ultra-violet rays etc. that may occupy the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal apparently momentary states of matter successive one after another in consciousness but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness
Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical through what medium does it extend It is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past or the ever-existent past-fantasy future Three seconds flat is the usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events
The body senses and brain in common with all matter have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible inaudible and intactible to them Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep
If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams however bizarre their combinations denies that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded from views of diverse realities although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life
Dr. H. V. Hilprecht Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania dreamed that a Babylonian priest associated with the king Kurigalzu 1300 B.C. escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic and corrected an error in its identification As a matter of fact the incorrect classification the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht was about to be published by him the following day Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription together with other new evidence fully corroborated the ancient priest's information Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite and imagined it must have been German or English
We may conclude that all six points of information ostensibly given by the dream priest could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning But in denying any physical reality for this dream how could the brain possibly compose that realistic vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout violent break or sudden substitution Which theory is more fantastic 1 That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor's brain or 2 That the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal gradient frequencies across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met
The degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determines whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled prevision or the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling No doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper's mind Probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake When we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority they of course impress us as anything familiar Nevertheless there are notably frequent instances of deja vue in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before a feeling which though vague withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists If deja vue is an illusion then peculiarly it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people
Chauncey Depew one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination was attending a convention at Saratoga where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before and he had something to prove he had
One week before the convention Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson gazing at the opposite shore

The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here
So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School Lake Placid New York In this one sentence he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school
Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value care for its origin and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients the food does taste good When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments the athletic programs and the most important phase the educational opportunities
Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands These contemporary structures beautifully adapted to a school in the country are home to 60 children ages eight to fourteen grades four through eight From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June
The Director Walter E. Clark believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare To him this means caring for the whole child providing basic nutrition and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind
Improved farming methods The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school In a climate hostile to agriculture Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques
Where a growing season may with luck allow 60 days without frost and where the soil is poor sandy quick-drying and subject to erosion many farmers fail Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat
Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil
To give up these notions required a revolution in thought Mr. Clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading Organic Gardening And Modern Nutrition in a search for help with his problems
Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains After reading Plowman's Folly by Edward H. Faulkner he stopped plowing
The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program poultry for eggs pigs to eat garbage a beef herd and wastes of all kinds Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells
All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader
Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity Soon after the method changed visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist when in reality it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this
To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency he pointed to the nearby driveway and said This soil used to be like that hard packed road over there
People and soils respond slowly says Walter Clark but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used
The garden supplies enough carrots turnips rutabagas potatoes beets cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar The carrots sometimes make it through the winter the cabbage and squash keep until March or April There is never enough corn peas or strawberries
Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter
New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment After the soil the kitchen says Mr. Clark The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread
Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push At first the kitchen help was tolerant but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves You make French toast with whole-wheat bread was an early complaint Of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread but the children liked it better
Homemade bread Mrs. Clark as house manager planned the menus and cared for the ordering Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour Once the grains are ground vitamin E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week
A mill stands in a room off the kitchen Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat oats and soy beans and turns on the motor She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma It is well liked by the children and faculty
There is one problem with the bread Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds
Hot freshly-ground cereal The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years though at one time that was all they ever served When the chance came they first eliminated cold cereal once a week then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day
They serve cracked wheat oats or cornmeal Occasionally the children find steamed whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call buckshot At the beginning of the school year the new students eat the cereal right away but within a short time they are eating it voraciously
When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal The school has received letters from parents asking What happened to Johnny He never used to like any hot cereal now the only kind he wants Where can we get this cereal he likes so much
Body-building foods Salads are served at least once a day Vegetables are served liberally Most come from the root cellar or from the freezer Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark Lillian did you put nuts in the bread today
Milk appears twice a day The school raises enough poultry pigs and beef cattle for most of their needs Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility
Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver tongue and heart are planned once a week Also salt water fish is on the table once a week
For deserts puddings and pies are each served once a week Most other desserts are fruit in some form fresh fruits once daily at least sometimes at snack time Dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm
Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways Following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont
Wheat-germ brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce meat loaves Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves
Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged Drinking with meals is also discouraged pitchers of water merely appear on the tables
Nothing is peeled The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues The cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin C content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible
Wholesome snacks no candy Since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains
On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail They learn to like these so well that it surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time They tasted good to him so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey
Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking Candy is not allowed Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts but no candy
Nourishing meals Mr. Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit hot cereal milk honey whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs The heavy meal comes in the middle of the day Soup is often the important dish at supper Homemade of meat bones and vegetables it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins
The school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day
Outdoor exercises Even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition Mr. Clark felt the school had a good health program Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule A vigorous program existed in skiing skating sports and overnight hiking
Healthier children Since the change to better nutrition he feels he can report on improvements in health though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof
Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment

Buffeted by swirling winds the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below
Good old iron compass He thought
A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream Vermont's main railroad line was prostrate And in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927 the worst natural disaster in the state's history the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails
Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday November 4 1927 when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices those who still had offices and wondered how to move the mail The state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks And once medicine food clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims communications and the mail were the next top problems
From Burlington outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent N. Y. But what came in was piling up The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord N. H. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state it seemed a likely temporary solution easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too
The question was Where to land There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged Jenny and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base
The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water and bridges were crumpled and gone Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry Vermont National Guard laid out runways on Wilson flat high on Millstone Hill The Barre Aviation Field was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood
Though the makeshift airports were ready the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule They had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather in and out of established airports And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War 1 planes It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air They had to act fast for letters were clogging the terminals
Down in Concord New Hampshire was a flier in the right place at the right time Robert S. Fogg a native New Englander had been a World War 1 flying instructor barnstormer and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport Tall wiry dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history Piloting a Curtiss Navy MF flying boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925 he had inaugurated the original Rural Delivery air service in America
During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927 dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes In Concord Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map The ship was a Waco biplane one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled 225/hp Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long the Waco was entered to compete in the On-to-Spokane Air Derby of 1927 As a matter of fact Fogg and his plane get beyond Pennsylvania in the race an engine oil leak forced him down but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers So with all this experience Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract His work began just six days after the flood
By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State House when the wind was right and used Wilson flat above Barre when it Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory Each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River
But Fogg they countered we get over there And besides you seem to make it all right here It took a tragedy to bring things to a head After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed and his pilot Lt. Franklin Wolfe badly injured With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside
Faced with this situation Postmaster Charles F. McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington trip and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of Berlin A long flat known as the St. John field seemed to answer their purpose and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable they decided to use it
With a wary eye on the farmer's bull Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with a red table cloth As a wind direction indicator they tied a cotton rag to a sapling With these aids and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21 1927
Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches During the second week of operations Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department asking him to put on two airplanes and make two flights daily plus one Sunday trip Since Fogg's was a one-man one-plane flying service this meant that he would have to do both trips flying alone 600 miles a day under sub-freezing temperature conditions
Over the weeks America's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home Always troubled by poor circulation in his feet he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them A sheep-lined leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit The airman's stock answer to you cold Became Yes the first half hour is tough but by then so numb I notice it
As daylight began to show through the frosty windows Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U. S. Weather Station at Northfield Vermont for temperature and wind-velocity readings Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station Ceilings were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E. Hartwell
Out at the airport each morning Fogg's skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover Wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay Bob Fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven disregarding rain snow and sleet in true postal tradition Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead Sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog but 85% of his trips were completed
Plane radios were not yet available and once in the air Fogg flew his ship by compass a good memory for landmarks as seen from above and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation Often threading through the overcast he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad When driving rain or mist socked in one valley Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes
The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips It ticked over smoothly idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St. John field
Sometimes on a return trip the aviator would go upstairs high over the clouds There take a compass reading figure his air speed and deduce that in a certain number of minutes be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him Bob Fogg have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems At the end of the calculated time nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable
Usually back in Concord by noon there was just time to get partially thawed out refuel and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the second trip Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country
The flyer had his share of near-misses At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated Once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up At a nod of his head they let go turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet
One afternoon during a cold powdery snowstorm Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field

Are you retiring now If so are you saying Where did the last few years go How did I get to be sixty-five so fast What do I do now
Yes retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire We always thought we would die with our boots on Out of the blue comes talk of pension plans Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon Still it seems in the far future Suddenly one day up it pops Sixty-five years and had it
So now what Oh sure thought about it before in a hazy sort of way But It never seemed real never seemed as if it could happen to you only to the other fellow
Now Here it is How am I going to live What am I going to do Where do I go from here
A great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers Are you one of these
If so you are of the old school You are conscientious hard working honest accurate a good penman and a stickler for a job well done with no loose ends Everything must balance to the last penny Also you can spell without consulting a dictionary for every other word You never are late for work and seldom absent

happened The answer is a new era
Now looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals calculated risks and I.B.M. machines The Planning Dept. comes into existence All sorts of plans come to life This is followed by a boom in conferences Yes sir Conferences become very popular When a plan burst its seams hasty conferences supply the necessary patch and life goes merrily on called progress The new way of life face it You had your day and it was a good day Let this generation have theirs Time marches on
Well to get back to the problem of retirement Every retiring person has a different situation facing him Some have plenty of money some have very little money Some are blest with an abundance of good health some are in poor health and many are invalids Some have lovely homes some live in small apartments Some have beautiful gardens some not even a blade of grass Some have serenity of mind the ability to accept what they have and make the most of it a wonderful gift to have believe me some see only darkness the bitter side of everything Well whatever you have it got to learn to live with it
Now The question is How are you going to live with it
You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot Yes You can do this But if you do your life will be just one thing unhappiness complete and unabridged
It seems to me the first thing got to do to be happy is to face up to your problems no matter what they may be Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life One thing I am sure of you must get an interest in life got to do something
Many of you will say Well what can I do
Believe me There are many many things to do Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl If you think of a thing to do try something anything Maybe you will surprise yourself
True We are not all great artists I frankly draw a straight line Maybe you are not that gifted either but how about puttering around with the old paints You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it Anyway bet you have a lot of fun
Do you like to sew Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes interest you Do you love to run up a hem sew on buttons make neat buttonholes If you do go to it There is always a market for this line of work Some women can sit and sew crochet tat or knit by the hour and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work Where sewing is concerned a total loss When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on or get out the safety pins
Then again always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs Not for me but perhaps just the thing for you
Well about mosaic tile ceramics or similar arts and crafts Some people love to crack tile and amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time
How about the art of cooking Do you yearn to make cakes and pies or special cookies and candies There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy in spite of low calorie diets cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary
Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood Some make beautiful chairs cabinets chests doll houses etc. Perhaps you do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood Outside of cutting your fingers maybe you would come up with nothing at all but then again you might turn out some dandy little gadgets
Some women get a real thrill out of housework They love to dust scrub polish wax floors move the furniture around from place to place take down the curtains put up new ones and have themselves a real ball Maybe your forte It certainly mine I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure where it belongs
Perhaps you would like to become a writer This gives you a wide and varied choice Will it be short stories fiction nonfiction biography poetry children's stories or even a book if you are really ambitious
Ever since I was a child I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing If you do decide to write you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection be discouraged This is just being a normal writer Just let the rejection slips fall where they may and keep on plugging and finally you will make the grade Few new writers have their first story accepted so they tell me But it could happen and it may happen to you
Then always hobbies collecting stamps coins timetables salt and pepper shakers elephants dogs dolls shells or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires
I can hear some of you folks protesting You say But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby I got that kind of money
True It does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free How about a rock collection or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors Then take flowers They are many and varied Also scrap books collecting newspaper pictures and clippings or any items of interest to you getting interested in something that counts
As for me I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles I love puzzles to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands So far the covers have never been off the boxes I just have time to do half the things I want to do now
So in closing fellow retired members I advise you to make the most of each day enjoy each one to the n'th degree Travel if you can Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet
Good Luck To one and all Good Days ahead An important criterion of maturity is creativity The mature person is creative What does it mean to be creative a term we hear with increasing frequency these days When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist to produce where nothing was before to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power We are creative it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake building a chicken coop or producing a book to founding a business creating a League of Nations or developing a mature character
All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity if it is only to reproduce a form like their own While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability An animal bird or insect creates either a burrow or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms
It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more It is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator
Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms but even more importantly he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes acrobats dancers musicians and artists developing many potentialities We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles By this same combination of the will and the imagination each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that Man is the being that can continually remake himself the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation
So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process
Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity

Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote Victorian past that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation
Perhaps but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance Joking and talking may be freer and easier but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women
Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place That is locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment
If the wedding party lasted late and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time day or night for that purpose
First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen
One thing should be clear to both husband and wife neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act Ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding and suspicion
The hymen is in essence a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations Hymen in fact is the Greek word for membrane
Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse As might be expected girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity
It is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations
But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs Some hymens are so strongly developed that they be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood More rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration
Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated These cases for all their rarity are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds
In recent times when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention Obviously the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride
Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or preferably to dilate it
As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina
This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation This is obvious when it is remembered that during childbirth the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby
The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman That is when first penetration takes place the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain
The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological Since it is a purely professional situation none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved By using instruments of gradually increasing size the vagina is gently and with minimum pain at each stage taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape
In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl She learns how to relax them to accept instead of contracting them to repel the entering object
Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation
When no medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value Folk-lore superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints
The importance of loving tenderness is obvious The long unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration
Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin But during the same examination two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall the bottom of the vagina in the same position without any pain and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times
These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making
In fact the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon
Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all
Such talk is seriously in error Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride both physically and psychologically The insistent forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen
The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it
Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax This is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife
Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them
The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost
Now while he uses talk caresses or requires caresses from her his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire
A final word The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment
Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid
If the early approaches are wise understanding and patient the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older
Writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures titled The Nude A Study In Ideal Form Kenneth Clark declares The human body as a nucleus is rich in associations It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves
Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions precipitated by the nude form
The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality Differences were related to social economic and educational backgrounds Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations
Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had never seen her entirely naked while another woman boasting an equal number of years of married life is proud of having shared the nudist way of life the really free natural nude life for most of that period
Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as lewd and pornographic a threat and danger to all the young or good or religious or moral persons
The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the natural honest free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration
One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the clean healthful free way of natural life in nudism who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit

In tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony The partners each bring to it unselfish love and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy
At its most ecstatic moments husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares Everything else is closed away
This is the ideal But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship In the past it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed
In a growing number of American homes marriage counselors report the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships It is she who decides the time the place the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics not the husband The whole act is tailored to her pleasure and not to theirs
Beyond a certain point of course no woman can be dominant nature has seen to that But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed
Of course there remain many old-fashioned marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy Yet even in these marriages psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly The meekest most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards
To many experts this trend was inevitable They consider it simply a sign of our times Our society has emancipated the woman giving her new independence and new authority It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role
The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book Release From Sexual Tensions It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive too
Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous It can in fact wreck a marriage
When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her And she begins to regard him as savage bestial and unworthy
On the other hand wifely supremacy demeans the husband saps his self-respect and robs him of his masculinity He is a target of ridicule to his wife and often since private affairs rarely remain private to the outside world as well
A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness declares Dr. Calderone This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists Dr. Maurice E. Linden director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health
When the roles of husband and wife are reversed so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower Dr. Linden says the effects on their whole relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous
In one extreme case cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded To win her favors her husband first took an additional job then desperately began to embezzle from his employer Caught at last he was sentenced to prison While he was in custody his wife divorced him
More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor This woman repeatedly complained she was too tired for marital relations To please her her husband assumed some of the domestic chores Finally he was cooking washing dishes bathing the children and even ironing and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them
One wife described by a New York psychologist so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis After every money argument she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor
Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed
The wife is likely to be young sophisticated smart as a whip often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband
The husband is usually a well-educated professional preoccupied with his job often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is rock the boat
Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area
More often though he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home
Some psychologists in fact suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives The wife's attempt at control these psychologists contend is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job
Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative Unless her husband also desires sex the act be consummated Generally however in such marriages as those cited the husband is at his wife's mercy
The pattern says Dr. Morton Schillinger psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night
No one seriously contends of course that the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world After all the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as Dr. Schillinger points out There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom
Furthermore Dr. Calderone says a certain number of docile retiring men always have been around They frigid and they homosexual just restrained in all of life They like to be dominated One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik New York psychiatrist that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor Asked why he replied primly Because no activity for a gentleman
But such cases were in the past unusual Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male even the Bible appears to endorse the concept
Family survival on our own Western frontier for example could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed
This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner
In those days a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere Grandma expected to like it Dr. Marion Hilliard the late Toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of the '90s Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as used by their husbands and history indicates they often quite literally were
When was the turning point When did women begin to assert themselves sexually
Some date it from woman suffrage others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin Virtually everyone agrees however that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs
Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing money-handling and home maintenance She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless She liked this taste of authority and independence and with darkness was not likely to give it up
Very few wives says Dr. Calderone who balance the checkbook fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well
And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response
In fact the noted psychologist and sex researcher Dr. Albert Ellis has declared flatly that women are sexually superior to men According to Dr. Ellis the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner Not surprisingly Dr. Ellis says some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities
Yet paradoxically according to Dr. Maurice Linden many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them An aggressive woman wants a man to demand not knuckle under When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness Dr. Linden says the wife in turn finds him inadequate Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction
One such wife Dr. Linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list
In some cases however domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed the one place he can still be champion If his on-the-job problems work out he may return to his old pattern Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man or his wife because he or she feels age creeping up
On the other hand a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive asking psychologists say for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted
In any case Dr. Calderone remarks such problems are a couple's own affair and always be measured by a general yardstick As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex it makes little difference if one or the other dominates Dr. Calderone declares The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment
Other experts say however that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period it is likely to shake the marriage And just as domination today often begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband
To get a marriage back where it belongs comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute the husband must take some very basic steps He must begin paradoxically by becoming more selfish He must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding and less understanding
Too many husbands Dr. Schillinger continues worry about how well doing and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play

She gave herself a title Lady Diana Harrington
The New York D.A. gave her another The Golden Girl of cafe society
Houston police gave her a third less flamboyant title prostitute
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 1960 Diane Harris Graham 30 D.O.A. circumstances unusual
Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men there was money and with the two came luxury and liquor She was still in the play for pay business when she died a top trollop who had given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour
She never hid the fact that she liked to play Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial
It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot Mickey Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls
Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard in a swank hotel of course She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington a name that made some of the gossip columns
It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best
Clad in mink and diamonds she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge
This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society
In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him
At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey He was the official procurer for King Farouk now in exile She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty She lied in order to get it
We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country She has been acting as a prostitute
Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke
Diane sobbingly denied this to the court
a lie I never gave that boy a cent I am not a prostitute and I had only one very wealthy boy friend she said
During the course of the trial Jelke backed up part of that statement
Diane is the type of girl Jelke said who get loving even on her wedding night unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor
But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her boy friends
She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager but with a sponsor instead of a chaperone As she told it a rich boy friend an old guy about 60 She was Mary Lou Brew then wide-eyed but not naive She had talked her boy friend into sending her to New York to take a screen test
The screen test was never made but Diane was She quickly moved into cafe society possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business
She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke
An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as Mr. Warfield the famous producer The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows
love to audition for you she gushed
The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance
After a few minutes he said I use you if you dance like that like to see you dance nude
She hastily complied Diane loved to dance in the nude something she was to demonstrate time and again
She developed another quaint habit Even among the fast set in which she was moving her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique
When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door she would tell him If you go home now scream More often than not he would bow to the inevitable
One who needed no such threats was a French financier One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel She wanted to go around the world but she settled for a French holiday
In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers
The Greek evidently fell for her Monsieur X recounted and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs about $300 and led her to the roulette tables
She could do no wrong at the tables that time And in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way Smarter than most gamblers she slipped away from the casino packed her bag and took the night train to Paris No one ever learned what happened to the Greek
The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel the George 5 bored the beautifully-built blonde so she high-tailed it to Rome
She teamed up with another beauty whose name has been lost to history and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious
To climax her Roman revels she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help
It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night
Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental
There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom Miss Harrington this was Diane's choice for a Roman name another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors
The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent The hotel staff as well as residents of the Excelsior told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall
They were wearing nothing but their scratches They were asked to leave the hotel No charges were filed
The girls after dressing were indignant
You do this to us Diane screamed We are Americans
In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador
With the Ambassador as headquarters she continued to promote good will abroad Of course her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it but then there is a limit to what one person can do
By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world She thought royal status might come her way when while she was still in Rome she met Pulley Bey a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt
A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way
It was a strange relationship Pulley Bey spoke no English Diane spoke no Italian or French She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet
Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him the friend continued It seemed as though she were always auditioning
No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months vainly hoping to see Farouk
Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key
She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her Tewfik Badrawi Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company
So extensive became her circle of admirers Egyptian police said that her escapades caused distrust
The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little world but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down When Farouk was overthrown police picked up his personal pimp Pulley Bey They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport
The cagey Pulley Bey who spoke no English had taken the passport so that Diane leave the country without his approval Officials provided a temporary passport good only for return to the United States
And return to the United States she did into waiting arms the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney's office
Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House of Detention a terribly overcrowded prison
It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room with her meals taken at Vesuvio's an excellent Italian restaurant
Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney
With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous Lady Harrington
Several years ago she married a Houston business man Robert Graham She later divorced Graham who is believed to have moved to Bolivia
Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring Last May they said she admitted being a prostitute
The next time the police saw her she was dead
It was September 20 1960 in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles She had had a party with a regular visitor Dr. William W. McClellan
McClellan who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction was with her when she died He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time When he realized she was dead he called two lawyers and then the police
When the police arrived they found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently
The blonde's nude body was in bed a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls
An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's body Police theorize that a combination of dope drink and drugs killed her
I think that maybe she wanted it this way a vice squad cop said A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date She was on the junk and they slide fast when that happens At least she never knew what the bottom was like I am a carpet salesman
I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East We cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy neon-lit chromium-plated suburban stores
I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams wall-to-wall carpeting
There is only one trouble with this big beautiful dream From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare
People come to me with confidence They depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little
But I knowingly abuse their confidence

Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer accompanied by a friend visited him in Bakersfield California several months ago as a prospective patient Doctor Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes Then by squeezing her foot three times he came up presto with a different diagnosis with each squeeze She had he informed her kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it He knew just the thing for her a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator machine
As he applied the applicator extending from the machine which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo Yes the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything he assured her Did she know he asked why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health The human body he pointed out for example required 33 units of blue light For that reason he informed her the Lord made the sky blue Continuing glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her
you worry This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body
Cancer Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked You tell me I had cancer
You have it all right But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about Why I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body
He urged her to buy one of his machines for $300 When she said that she have the money he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment a can of sage to make her look like a girl again and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away
Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day After another treatment with the machine he told her that her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine
When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain Leaving Lee's office Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician who treated her for burned tissue For several days she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment
Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines For Mrs. Shaefer who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans gathered by the tape recorder under her friend's clothing proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee The charge violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs The sentence 360 days' confinement in the county jail
An isolated case of quackery By no means Rather it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals wires and radio parts
With these gadgets impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs ticks and buzzes he then carries out a vicious medical con game capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age He milks the latest scientific advances translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer
The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10,000 anything the traffic will bear He may call himself a anaprapath a physiotherapist an electrotherapist a naturopath a sanipractor a medical cultist a masseur a doctor or what have you Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence
The medical device pirate of today of course is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines His plunder is therefore far higher running into hundreds of millions
According to the Food And Drug Administration FDA Doctor Ghadiali Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique and Dr. Wilhelm Reich to name three notorious device quacks succeeded respectively in distributing 10,000 5000 and 2000 fake health machines
Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland Sarah Gross a dress shop proprietor paid $1020 to a masseur and Mr. A. a laborer paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines the radioclast and the diagnometer Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually You will come up with a frightening total
why the FDA the American Medical Association AMA and the National Better Business Bureau BBB have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually
The Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently are at the highest level in history Similarly the American Cancer Society ACS the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation and the BBB have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high For example the BBB has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago
Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures however believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation turned up by their inevitably limited policing of the real loot of the medical racketeer In this sense authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative
The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important of course But it is our health more precious than all the money in the world that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away By preying on the sick by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity
Typically Sarah Gross and Mr. A both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her As a result she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was using were phony She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized
Mr. A. her fellow townsman also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife a woman suffering from an incurable disease multiple sclerosis and himself Mr. A has recovered but he is justifiably a bitter man a lot of hard-earned money to lose he says today Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments
And there was the case of Tom Hepker a machinist who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine After his pains got worse Tom decided to see a real doctor from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung Yes Tom caught it in time to stay alive But a welfare case now a human wreck thanks to this modern witch doctor
But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering In such diseases as cancer tuberculosis and heart disease early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal Moreover the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide For instance
In Chicago some time ago Mr. H. age 27 a diabetic since he was six stopped using insulin because he had bought a magic spike a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy and its rays will cure any disease you have said the company Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice
Doris Hull suffering from tuberculosis was taken by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll a sanipractor a licensed drugless healer in Spokane Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his radionic machine and twirling some knobs fee $50
His prescription hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water Although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him Carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water Inevitably Mrs. Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis weighing 60 pounds Moreover her husband and child contracted T.B. from her Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for his wife's death
In California a few years ago a ghoul by the name of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died reconditioning them and selling them at $185 each When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 one of his victims was not around to testify He was dead of cancer
By no means are these isolated cases Unfortunately says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens who has prosecuted many device quacks the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court
Death Have no doubt about it where device quackery can lead The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines substituted for valid medical cures have hastened the deaths of thousands
Who are the victims of the device quacks Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target Says Wallace F. Jannsen director of the FDA's Division of Public Information Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis rheumatism diabetes and cancer People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people like Mr. A. who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged

Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year His grades had gone steadily downhill and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school
Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned Then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy from next door let the cat out of the bag The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick Bugs Bunny because his teeth protruded
When Richard's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws their young son was interested During the year that followed Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance
Richard Stewart is no special case The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment says Dr. Allan G. Brodie professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field
What do parents need to know about those years of the braces in order not to waste a child's time and their money How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken What is it likely to cost
Tooth fit explained occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed Malocclusion or a bad fit is what parents need to look out for One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth an overdeveloped lower jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion
These two basic malformations have of course many variations A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw
Crooked overlapping twisted or widely spaced teeth
Front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close
Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close
The eyeteeth third from the middle on top counting each front tooth as the first beginning to protrude like fangs
Second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out making a double row
Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition However this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family
Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking tongue-thrusting or lip-sucking but important to remember that a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth but after that if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent it will have an effect
Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long If a child loses a molar at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble If baby teeth are retained too long the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place
Correction can save teeth every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth Some such youngsters rarely smile or they try to speak with the mouth closed In certain cases as in Dick Stewart's a child's personality is affected Yet from the dentist's point of view bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons
Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots This serious condition popularly known as pyorrhea is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults
Then too misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles increasing the likelihood of rapid decay For these and other reasons says Dr. Brodie orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth
The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system Because of these chewing troubles a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping
The when and how of straightening most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 says Dr. Brodie
In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw they are not anchored directly to the bone Abnormal pressure applied over a period of time produces a change in the bony deposit so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided
What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office On her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays photographs tooth measurements and tooth prints an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws
If he decides to proceed he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs This appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone As the tooth moves bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows and no faster
If teeth are moved too rapidly serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place explains Dr. Brodie Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face
During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness but after a short time this will disappear Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay When in place a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered
Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depending on the severity of her condition During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth
Last comes the retention stage Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth Susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day
Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist
How long will this take Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct
What is the cost
The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago An average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000
Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner says Dr. Brodie
To become an orthodontist a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist
Costs may seem high but they used to be even higher says Dr. Brodie Fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago
The reason People today are aware of the value of orthodontics and as a result there are more practitioners in the field
Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years In many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents
Research helps families growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head growth started 20 minutes after children's births
In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent he says Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does and that helps us know what we can do
This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment For example a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another In the past an orthodontist might have tried over four or five years to straighten and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that despite some growth would never accommodate them Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately
In other cases in view of present-day knowledge of head growth orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment The child is kept on call and the orthodontist watches the growth Nature often takes care of the problem says Dr. Brodie A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity
That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist against their dentist's advice that their child have orthodontic work done too early Both because of our culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment he urges
Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money Plaster of Paris once utilized in making impressions of teeth has been replaced by alginates gelatin-like material that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child
Prevention is best as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be
After your child's baby teeth are all in usually at the age of two and one half to three time for that first dental appointment Dr. Brodie advises Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year
To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising your dentist can do these things He can correct decay thus preventing early loss of teeth If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay and if no preventive steps are taken the other teeth may shift out of position become overcrowded and malformed In turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them

From time to time the medium mentions other people around him who were on the other side and reports what they are saying After a while there come initials and names and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames As the hour progresses the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements There are a few prognoses of coming events
Another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different content but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading Some mediums speak in practical down-to-earth terms while others may stress the spiritual Not all as a matter of fact consider themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased In fact some sensitives rule this out preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ESP on this side of the veil However that may be people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased or seek indications for future plans They may of course be curiosity seekers or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship
The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state so that the sitter can make comments ask and answer questions instead of talking with a control who speaks through an entranced sensitive What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation
But it is not really only a conversation Many a sitter in a personal sitting has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind He himself might not have been really aware of his own mood it had been latent unspecified semi-conscious and only partly realized until she described it to him Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on pre-conscious moods and to clarify them
However in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium he did not receive a personal reading Instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing For this was to be a proxy sitting
As was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive Dr. Karlis Osis Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article New Research On Survival After Death Spring 1958 He remarked It has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter
The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central characters in this drama must be separated
One way to do this is by proxy sittings wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute the proxy sitter If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name given by the experimenter he possibly give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions
Sometimes in these experiments appointment sittings are used Here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator someone close to him who is deceased asking him to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for him In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator nothing else He gives this to the medium at the appointed time and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator As always a tape recording or detailed notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter
So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium's ESP and the absent sitter's mind It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range
Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved for it is recognized how elastic these readings can be how they can apply to many people and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case If you look at a reading meant for someone else you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you even when you were not in the picture at all An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a hit describing something accurately for him but can he really be sure that another sitter hearing the same statement would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances It is of course easy to see how J will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another A journey a little white house a change of outlook can apply to many people And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view which is by nature so personal One sitter may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed to him to another it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase Atta boy
To get around this quite difficult corner there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame Does that statement really sound as if it were for me significant in my particular life Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience
Conversely experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following which if they turned out to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant
He had four children two sets of twins After being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road He died of typhoid in 1921
Methods have been developed of assigning weights to statements that is it is known empirically that names beginning with R are more common than those beginning with Z that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights Specific dates would be important as would double names Various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical probabilities against which to measure the readings
In the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements It is very important indeed in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself Or on the other hand are unlikely facts being stated facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out
So after the sitting has been held several readings at one time are mailed and the distant sitter whose name or whose communicator's name was given to the medium must mark each little item as Correct Hit Incorrect Miss Doubtful or Especially Significant applying to him and he feels not to anyone else He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated by adding up the Hits and Significants with the weight placed on those in the sitter's own reading That is if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him the total experimental score falls
Conversely if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others a point is chalked up for the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material And there are some positive results though the final findings will not be known for a long time and then further research can be formulated
In another approach to the same procedure the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements Does she often speak of locations of cause of death Does she accurately give dates ages kind of occupation It is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her hits Now when so to speak the cream has been skimmed off and the items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the sensitive is at her best
Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses I feel cold the medium says or My leg aches My head is heavy Or perhaps she hears words or sounds such a noise of loud machinery or I hear a child crying or He says all here and glad to see you Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness with action and motion or a static view a house under a pine tree with a little stone path going up to the door The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors too or subjectively feels emotions Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually there If pressed by the sitter for more detail she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost as if she were physically going closer
If asked how she gets her impressions she probably can only say that she just gets them some more vividly than others Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how of atmosphere of one another's personalities moods intentions
Of course there is an element of training here these gifted people by concentration study guidance have learned to develop their power Simply using it increases its intensity I was told by one sensitive
Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and be taken at face value It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium has to translate these into meaning If communication with an entity on the other side is taking place this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism
During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement In this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained Though they are often heard clairaudiently as if a voice were speaking them in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols a slope to signify the name Hill for instance One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter

Farming is confining The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock
Livestock must be tended every day routinely A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens
Even if there are no livestock the farmer leave the farm for long periods particularly during the growing season
The worker who lives on a farm change jobs readily He leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice such a move may mean a loss of capital
Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life The farmer must get up early and at times work late at night Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain No matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up
It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably
Production may fall far below expectations Drought hail disease and insects take their toll of crops Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings even into his capital
Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year
The high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has subdivision possibilities Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high farm labor costs will also be high
A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations such as spraying or threshing and for these he may have to wait his turn There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job
The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented
If the farm is rented the rent must be paid If it is owned taxes must be paid and if the place is not free of mortgage there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of Advantages
A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability Caring for a calf a pig or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work
Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs
For some retired persons part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health
Generally the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city The savings are not as great however as is sometime supposed Usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more Where schools fire and police protection and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country real estate taxes are usually about the same
A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably
Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner
Land labor and equipment needed Part-time farming can take comparatively little land labor and equipment or a great deal It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation
General requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 Land Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use and for a small flock of chickens a cow and two pigs You could not of course raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small
If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale need more land
In deciding how much land you want take into account the amount need to bring in the income you expect But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development This is a highly speculative venture
Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm Labor If you have a year-round full-time job you expect to grow much more than your family uses unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help As a rule part-time farmers hire little help
In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1
List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time only what you are willing to use for farm work Equipment If you are going to produce for home use only you will need only hand tools You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing however
For larger plantings need some kind of power for plowing harrowing disking and cultivating If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor available for $300 to $500 with attachments 1960 prices These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing
Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises
You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed such as a spray rig a combine or a binder it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work
Selecting a farm Before you look for a farm need to know 1 the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake and 2 whether you want to buy or rent
Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture
If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy
Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm Location nearness to work Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities Then if you change jobs you necessarily have to sell the farm The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road Nearness to markets If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example you should be close to a town or city Kind of neighborhood Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes There are slums in the country as well as in the city Few rural areas are protected by zoning A tavern filling station junk yard rendering plant or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value Facilities in the area Check on the schools in the area the quality of teaching and the provision for transportation to and from them
Find out whether fire protection sewage system gas water mains and electrical lines are available in the locality If these facilities are not at the door getting them may cost more than you expect You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them
You get along without an adequate supply of pure water If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden Pond water can be filtered for human use but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses Topography and soil Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise If you tell get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist Soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones Small areas that right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop The house Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed check into the cost of making these improvements
Buying a farm The value of the farm to you will depend on Its worth as a place to live
The value of the products you can raise on it
The possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision
Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town Take into account the difference in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and the cost of travel to work
Next estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm To do this set up a plan on paper for operating the farm List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices The total is the probably gross income from farming
To find estimated net farm income subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth but charge something for it Otherwise you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor
To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way

Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge For almost two months the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers graybeards adolescents babies starved beaten to death strangled machine-gunned gassed burned One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David nor the gratuitous sadism of SS officers Public relations strategists everywhere watching the reaction of the German press the liberal press the lunatic-fringe press listening to their neighbors studying interviews with men and women on the street cried out Too much too much the mind of the audience is becoming dulled the horrors are losing their effect And still another witness one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot
Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs Counsel for the defense however shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections rarely raised an objection Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming if not exhausting effect likely to improve his client's chances Those who feared emotionalism at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies Interruptions came largely from the bench which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on though it too made no serious effort to choke off the flow
But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York In each of the last the trial marked the beginning of a new course in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard These trials were properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate Of what new course could it mark the beginning The Eichmann case looked to the past not to the future It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there are Jews As such it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a message
It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial said Ben Gurion and not the Nazi regime alone but anti-Semitism throughout history How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism And if it was not an individual who was in the dock why was the Trial as we shall observe later all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a fiend These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case
It might be contended of course that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument One who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages Shout at Eichmann though he might the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism Yes he believed that the Jews were enemies of the Reich and such a belief is of course typical of patriotic anti-Semites but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things The real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself In regard to Eichmann it was to be found in the Nazi outlook which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could as Eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer Not through fear of disobeying orders as Eichmann kept trying to explain but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal and the more outrageous the better Well try it At any rate the substance of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the SS and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent
But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem why was it not identified and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany as well as in Poland Czechoslovakia Hungary The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state including the Reich Minister of the Interior the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan the Reich Minister of Justice the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry transportation civilian agencies of government Heydrich in opening the Conference followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence economic strangulation forced emigration and evacuation In other words the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective as a readiness for murder This in fact it turned out to be Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible once the wheels had began to turn persons controlling German industries social institutions and armed forces became through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an innocent dislike of Jews as do others like them today The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of mere anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of anti-Semitism among the Germans which Hitler stimulated and transformed But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned the press seems to have missed it
Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states Certainly one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations splitting apart individuals and groups arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses pulverizing trust and personal dignity and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a Jew he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform clinging to the enemy-Jew idea he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him Is this the type of citizen you desire The Trial should have asked the nations But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt the Prosecutor more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one would have none of it
Finally if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters i.e. Germany Poland Hungary Czechoslovakia and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity Denmark Holland Italy Bulgaria France Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting
As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions and by reports memoirs and survivors' accounts

In Poughkeepsie N.Y. in 1952 a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff Three agreed but four declined and were suspended After a flood of protests they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 The peace of the community was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the incident felt uneasy
In New York City in 1958 the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months until the city's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy
A year later in Albany N.Y. a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association Immediately the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience
These incidents typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries Where it is not actually erupting it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano ready to explode at any moment
The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation
The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level Instead of emotional recrimination loaded phrases and sloganeering we need a dispassionate study of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached
All too frequently points out James O'Gara managing editor of Commonweal Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and particularly by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades All too often our language is unduly harsh
The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting already existing between Catholics and Non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring as many Non-Catholics imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed Family planning is encouraged so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring
Pope Pius 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life if there are serious reasons such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical eugenic economic and social indications This means that such factors as the health of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring
These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning The laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons The Roman Catholic Church however sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning
Catholics Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning but disagree over the methods to be used The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method also known as the use of the infertile or safe period The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author It involves no frustration of nature's laws but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives allowing the couple free choice
There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement The grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural Old Testament the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive entirely apart from Scripture in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods
The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end This conclusion is based on two propositions that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain given physical arrangements
Thus man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation the propagation of the race Moreover man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws not frustrate or mock them
Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines without taking up arms against those who disagree with them Why is it so different in regard to birth control It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief or at least the practical consequences thereof upon others
It is always a temptation for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant one to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past
Consider what happened during World War 1 when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful With over four million American men away at war Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public With the return of our soldiers it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers racketeers hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history The so-called noble experiment came to an inglorious end
That tumultuous painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today
Up to the turn of the century contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral unnatural and contrary to divine law This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries Today the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction The various Lambeth Conferences expressing the Anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally
In 1920 the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception together with the grave dangers physical moral and religious thereby incurred and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the Conference declared We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives
In 1930 the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children but conceded that in certain limited circumstances contraception might be morally legitimate
In 1958 the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere
Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action In March 1931 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control As to the necessity the committee declared for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children and consequently of control of conception there can be no question There is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right
Since then many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared it at times to be a religious duty What determines the morality they state is not the means used but the motive In general the means excluding abortion that prove most effective are considered the most ethical
This development is reflected in the action taken in February 1961 by the general board of the National Council of Churches the largest Protestant organization in the Aj The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives
The general board declared Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right The general Protestant conviction is that motives rather than methods form the primary moral issue provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception
An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations but also deemed at certain times to be a positive religious duty This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control
For all concerned with social-welfare legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear profound and far-reaching To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment
This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin The civil law is concerned with public crimes Only confusion failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself

On April 17 1610 the sturdy little three-masted bark Discovery weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool London and floated down the Thames toward the sea She carried besides her captain a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America
Seventeen months later on September 6 1611 an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay When she reached port she was found to have on board only eight men all near starvation The captain was gone and the mate was gone The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman
What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months What happened to the fourteen missing men These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time For hundreds of years the evidence available consisted of 1 the captain's fragmentary journal 2 a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors 3 a note found in a dead man's desk on board and 4 several second-hand reports All told they offered a highly confused picture
But since 1927 researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information Not enough to do away with all doubts but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage
Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations First they wanted to clarify a tantalizing bizarre enigma Second they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps on American towns and counties on a great American river and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas
The name Henry Hudson
This is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able or ever probably will be able to determine
The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years Each time his objective had been the same a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East In 1607 and 1608 the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia Twice he had failed and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again
In 1609 the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson gave him two learned geographers fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon and supplied him with Dutch sailors This time he turned westward to the middle Atlantic coast of North America His chief discovery was important the Great North later the Hudson River but it produced no northwest passage
When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth England in the fall of 1609 word of Hudson's findings leaked out and English interest in him revived The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth By springtime he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry Prince of Wales He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one the largest he had ever commanded
The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear A century of exploration had established that a great land mass North and South America lay between Europe and the Indies One by one the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded In fact Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes
But there remained one mysterious unexplored gap far to the north Nearly twenty-five years before Captain John Davis had noted as he sailed near the Arctic Circle a very great gulf the water whirling and roaring as it were the meeting of tides He named this opening between Baffin Island and Labrador the Furious Overfall Later it was to be called Hudson Strait
In 1602 George Waymouth in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway
Even Hudson experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames Ahead were perilous ice-filled waters On previous voyages it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain On the second voyage he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will which was obviously not the case On the third voyage a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic
Worse his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before Of only one could he be sure young John Hudson his second son The mate Robert Juet who had kept the journal on the Half Moon was experienced but he was a bitter old man ready to complain or desert at any opportunity Philip Staffe the ship's carpenter was a good worker but perversely independent Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest lukewarm ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis
But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer And he refused to be anything else
It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships He was a Londoner married with three sons The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage In 1610 Hudson was probably in his early forties a good navigator a stubborn voyager but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames There at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene whom Hudson listed as a clerk Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred pimps panders and whores He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend where the Discovery picked him up
For the first three weeks the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain then turned westward On May 11 she reached Iceland Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called Lousie Bay The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome With Hudson looking on his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon Edward Wilson The issue was settled on shore Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England With difficulty Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship and they sailed from Iceland
Early in June the Discovery passed Desolation southern Greenland and in mid-June entered the Furious Overfall Floating ice bore down from the north and west Fog hung over the route constantly Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole
As the bergs grew larger Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay an inlet of the Great Strait After finding that its coasts led nowhere however he turned north again toward the main ice-filled passageway and the crew at first uneasy then frightened rebelled
The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd The great crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther
Instead of quelling the dissension as many captains of the era would have done Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances Hudson decided to be reasonable He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart which he set up in view of the crew Patiently he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives
When Hudson had finished the town meeting broke down into a general wordy argument One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds he would give ninety of them to be back in England Up spoke carpenter Staffe who said he give ten pounds to be home The statement was effective The meeting broke up Hudson was free to sail on
All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait avoiding ice and rocky islands On August 3 two massive headlands reared out of the mists great gateways never before so far as Hudson knew seen by Europeans To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high patched with ice and snow populated by thousands of screaming sea birds To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme for two of his backers
Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea now called Hudson Bay confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific After three weeks' swift sailing however the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas The ship halted The great sea to the westwards was a dead end
This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea but the solid bulk of the North American continent This was the bitter end and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure
Feverishly he tried to brush away this intuition North and south east and west back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay plowing furiously forward until land appeared then turning to repeat the process day after day week after week Hundreds of miles to the north the route back to England through the Furious Overfall was again filling with ice
The men were at first puzzled then angered by the aimless tacking Once more Juet's complaints were the loudest Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial
The trial was held September 10 Hudson presiding heard Juet's defense then called for testimony from crew members Juet had made plentiful enemies several men stepped forward Hands on Bible seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward
Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay The new mate was Robert Bylot talented but inexperienced There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves The important result however was that Juet and Francis Clemens the deposed boatswain became Hudson's sworn enemies
As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay every incident lessened the crew's respect for him Once after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed Just as it was being hauled inboard a sea hit the ship Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured The anchor cable would have been lost overboard but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe

Thomas Douglas fifth Earl of Selkirk a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company he purchased great blocks of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies Having achieved this end he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers The grant which stretched southward to Lake Traverse the headwaters of the Red was made in May 1811 and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier
Seven hundred miles south of York Factory at the Forks of the Red and the Assiniboine twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 By October the little colony about Fort Douglas present-day Winnipeg numbered 100 Within a few years the Scots engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley were joined by a group called Meurons The latter members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818
It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed all but fifty of the Scots Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food
The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul Minnesota When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States its British-born employees now become American citizens Joseph Rolette Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly continued in the fur business On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River Robert Dickson Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun In 1802 Henry referred to our new carts as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills
It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States In September 1817 at Fort Daer Pembina Dickson met the noble lord whom with the help of a band of Sioux he escorted to Prairie Du Chien During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England Upon arriving at Baltimore Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams Secretary of State at Washington inquiring about laws covering trade with Missouri and Illinois Territories This traffic he declared prophetically tho' it might be of small account at first would increase with the progress of our Settlements
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the Forks Fort Douglas and in December 1819 twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie Du Chien It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats With these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River present-day Minnesota river their 250 bushels of wheat 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake across into Lake Traverse and down the Red They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820 This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk Ab1,040 Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien until then the most advanced United States post In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the St. Peter's River the head of navigation on the Mississippi and began construction of Fort St. Anthony which upon completion was renamed in honor of its commander Colonel Josiah Snelling
It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good Hercules L. Dousman fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers Bailly after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse in the Sieux Country and reached Fort Garry as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called late in the fall He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States Observing their distressing condition Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation
As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota Dousman of Michilimackinac Michigan and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork flour liquor and tobacco Alexander McDonnell governor of Red River and James Bird a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company ordered such sundry articles to a value of Ab4,500
For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 the company suspected that the Pembina colony its own post and Fort Daer was on American territory Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north and by October John Halkett had torn down both posts floating the timber to the Forks in rafts I have done everything he wrote to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment Despite Company threats duly carried through to cut off supplies of powder ball and thread for fishing nets about 350 persons stayed in the village They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie Du Chien at great expense as well as danger
At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice snow fell on October 15 1825 and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi By fall 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis with a few going as far as Vevay Indiana a notable Swiss center in the United States In 1837 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling
Below the fort high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River At the point where they ended another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840 Its people including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 The resultant town platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission St. Paul was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River
While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate Accordingly though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company some settlers went into trade The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs Despite this prohibiton by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs In June 1845 the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the very vitals of the Company's trade and power To reduce further the flow of goods from England the Company's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men
With their customary source of supply cut off the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country Others carried pemmican from the Forks to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River as in the summer of 1847 when one trader Wells transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835 but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee
The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel

The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor Indeed no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive A Confederate observed that the Yankees were thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier Another reported that his comrades were in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house A third wrote that it was raining like poring peas on a rawhide Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression One wrote I am so hungry I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia look like the latter end of original sin and hard times A third remarked of slowness of Southerners they moved about from corner to corner as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god Still another annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive wrote yore letter was short and sweet jist like a roasted maget A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart my girl is none of your one-horse girls She is a regular stub and twister double geered She is well-educated and refined all wildcat and fur and Union from the muzzle to the crupper Humor found many modes of expression A Texan wrote to a male companion at home what has become of Halda and Laura When you see them again give them my love not best respects now but love by God William R. Stillwell an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History liked to tease his wife in his letters After he had been away from home about a year he wrote dear Wife if I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married I feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful A Yank disturbed by his increasing corpulence wrote I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer now I lay me down to sleep the gray-backs o'er my body creep if they should bite before I wake I pray the Lord their jaws to break Charles Thiot a splendid Georgia soldier differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation well-educated and nearly fifty years of age But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups name one of them Fall-in and the other Close-up and then shoot them both and that will be the end of Fall-in and Close-up The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as looseness of the bowels but a much more common designation was the sh-ts A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the the Virginia quickstep A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days I eat too much eggs and poark It sowered on my stomack and turn loose on me A Michigan soldier wrote his brother I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp on stumps pieces of bark drum heads or the knee In the South after the first year of the war paper and ink were very poor Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing i.e. after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads A Yank writing from Vicksburg May 28 1863 stated not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes but we take no notice of them now A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I dodge every time Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta reported the Yankees keep shooting so I am afraid they will knock over my ink so I will close
3 the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives But fathers often addressed communications to their small children and these full of homely advice are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community Occasionally they would write to the slaves Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro body servants to perform the menial chores such as cooking foraging cleaning the quarters shining shoes and laundering clothes Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond Petersburg Washington or Nashville But these comments are hardly printable An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles they thout I was a saint I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappy's But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk Some of the letters were pungently expressive An Ohio soldier who from a comrade just returned from leave received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister took pen in hand and delivered himself thus dear Sis Alf sed he heard that you and Hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf Dyer and let that orney thefin drunkard damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion he is too orney for hel I will shute him as shore as I sea him
Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia dear Pa Went out a skouting yesterday We got to one house where there were five secessionists They brok & run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun
Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers A Mississippi soldier wrote our General Reub Davis is a vain stuck-up illiterate ass An Alabamian wrote Col. Henry is an ignoramus fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn A Floridian stated that his officers were not fit to tote guts to a bear On December 9 1862 Sergeant Edwin H. Fay an unusual Louisianan who held A.B. and M.A. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana wrote his wife I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw His head contain enough sense to command a regiment much less a corps Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader He is not worth shucks But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command
Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers A Massachusetts soldier who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin wrote the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks They get all the glory and most of the pay and earn ten cents apiece on the average the drunken rascals Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against the other half
No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors One Federal soldier wrote the docters is no aconte hell will be filde with do(c)ters and offersey when this war is over Shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than by Union quackery
The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling from friendliness to extreme hatred The Rebs were to a Massachusetts corporal fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that they were the hardest looking set of men that ever I saw They looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary I strolled among the Alabamans on the right found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect They recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all In a similar vein but writing from the opposite side Thomas Taylor a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers in a letter to his wife stated you know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is Booty

The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world Thus if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore nationalism and imperialism at the outset
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence 1 Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred 2 As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness Its folklore and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account for group actions to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to become a cohesive force for national identification
One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War the steady currency of the Lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point Nor is it an accident that baseball growing into the national game in the last 75 years has become a microcosm of American life that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880s or that courses in American literature American civilization American anything have swept our school and college curricula
Of course nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century United States Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian writer or man in the street It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine After all the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control Anyone's identification with an international struggle whether warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes
In America such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land But we must never forget most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight to answer immediate needs almost always with conscious aims and ends Parson Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy And their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry Nathan Hale Andrew Jackson Davy Crockett Theodore Roosevelt and many many more
Therefore the scholar as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years will be mindful of two facts 1 Most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all 2 The concept that an American national folklore exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend
Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission It has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions rhymes and such literary forms of expression Related to written literature and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this Enthusiastically Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material
Naturally such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant As long as his material is Americana can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears democratic to his audience he remains satisfied
From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore On the one side we have the university professors and their students trained in Teutonic methods of research who have sought out collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic regional and occupational groups that make up this nation On the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material willy-nilly Unfortunately few of the artists writers movie producers dramatists and musicians who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways After all the field is large difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates In addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly in an age of print and easy communication within an ever-expanding and changing society The problems confuse even the experts
For that matter the experts themselves are a mixed breed Anthropologists housewives historians and such by profession they approach their discipline as amateurs collectors commercial propagandists analysts or some combination of the four They have widely varying backgrounds and aims They have little esprit de corps
The outlook for the amateur for instance is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque His love of folklore has romanticism in it and he care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote Folklore is his hobby and he all too rightly wishes it to remain as such The amateur is closely related to the collector who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field The collector enjoys the contact with rural life he hunts folklore for the very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located Fundamentally both these types the amateur and the collector are uncritical and many of them distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material
But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts one dominated by money the other by nineteenth-century German scholarship Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines The commercial propagandist who afford to be critical gets along well with the amateur from whom he feeds but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine His standards are of course completely foreign to those of the analyst To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although he deny his debt to the collector
The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors The work done by the analysts the men who really know what folklore is all about has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited learned audience Publishers want books that will sell recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint but moral material The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in As a result most people have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is they see it as a potpourri of charming moral legends and patriotic anecdotes with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone
If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each Does the writer know the difference between an ersatz ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure Is the writer propagandistic Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be
When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged In the first place a good many writers who are said to use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale Robert Frost for instance writes about rural life in New England but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems This has not however prevented publishers from labeling him a folk poet simply because he is a rural one In the second place a large number of writers making a more direct claim than Frost to being folk writers of one sort or another clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People Yes The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass Folklore as used by such writers really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude In fact there is much evidence to indicate they care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional ethnic and occupational limits Nevertheless with a reading public that longs for the good old days and with an awareness of our expanding international interests it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana real or fake and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk

As part of the same arrangement Torrio had in the spirit of peace and good will and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade The coalition was to prove inadvisable
O'Banion was a complex and frightening man whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others' He had a round frank Irish face creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body He carried three guns one in the right trouser pocket one under his left armpit one in the left outside coat pocket and was equally lethal with both hands He killed accurately freely and dispassionately The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol He was an expert florist tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths He had no apparent comprehension of morality he divided humanity into right guys and wrong guys and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under He had what was described by a psychologist as a sunny brutality He walked with a heavy list to the right as that leg was four inches shorter than the other but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns Landesco thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was in fact with his aggression and hostility and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain a casebook psychopath He was also at this time although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld the roughneck king
O'Banion was born in poverty the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer in the North Side's Little Hell close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested slum tenements among the bawdy houses honkytonks and sawdust saloons of his birthplace he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving police-dodging and housebreaking At the age of ten when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg Because of this he was known as Gimpy but as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface never in his presence In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's Cafe a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor
O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909 at seventeen when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary two years later he served another three months for assault Those were his only interludes behind bars although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 three for burglary and one for robbery But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was furnished by an alderman and the charge was nolle prossed On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted at a cost of $30,000 in bribes it was estimated As promptly as Torrio O'Banion jumped into bootlegging He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money Unlike the Sicilians he additionally conducted holdups robberies and safe-cracking expeditions and refused to touch prostitution He was also personally active in ward politics and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state I always deliver my borough as per requirements
But whose requirements Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic There was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time Q. carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards A. O'Banion in his pistol pocket But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans To forestall any change of allegiance the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay
The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West It was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts union racketeers ward heelers sold-out officials and gunmen The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time It included the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes
When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor the proprieter of a Loop gambling house But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times I knew I had been framed and withdrew almost at once
In fact O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds
This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians which prior to 1924 says Pasley had been maintained with more or less stealth but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings denounced by a clergyman as Belshazzar feasts at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters openly in the big downtown hotels Pasley continued They became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29
However this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal On Election Day November 4 he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men bribers and experts in forging repeat votes The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates
This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking He behaved publicly with a cocky swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado as when his bodyguard Yankee Schwartz complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller a prize-fight referee chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation who were Hirschey a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion Frank a policeman and Max the youngest To settle this slight O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop where he had learned Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy At the end of the performance Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave severely wounding him in the stomach A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle leaving him unhurt but in some distress O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested That sort of braggadocio for that sort of reason in the view of Torrio and Capone was a nonsense
A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300 to let it through One of the beer-runners telephoned O'Banion on a line tapped by the detective bureau and reported the situation O'Banion's reaction was Three hundred dollars To them bums Why I can get them knocked off for half that much Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen But in the meantime the beer-runner unhappy with this solution telephoned Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message Say Dionie I just been talking to Johnny and he said to let them cops have the three hundred He says he want no trouble
But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman For three years since the liquor territorial conference Torrio had with his elastic patience and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing They had suffered in sulky silence the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero
When as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month In six months O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon Saltis-McErlane and Druggan-Lake gangs and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory went up still higher until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and West Sides But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate At last even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal
Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era the Sibley warehouse robbery which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation Here was stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky These 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water

A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an earthquake or a volcanic eruption The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco
The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times Indeed a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood
One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 1755 its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast Tsunami are rare however in the Atlantic Ocean they are far more common in the Pacific Japan has had 15 destructive ones eight of them disastrous since 1596 The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town Ponoluu leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes
The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour The greater the depth of the water the greater is the speed of the wave Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour
Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest Usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells Not until they sailed home at the end of the day through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses were they aware of what had happened The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore
The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions
Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives Reefs are left high and dry and the beaches are covered with stranded fish At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground When a second quake came they dashed back to the beach fearing that they might be buried under landslides Just as they reached the shore the first huge wave crashed upon them
A tsunami is not a single wave but a series The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more because of their great length and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over The waves may keep coming for many hours Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest
Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography one of the world's foremost marine geologists He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves Their onrush and retreat he reported was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest On some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high The highest waves 55 feet occurred at Pololu Valley
Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms raised to the surface by the disturbance The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands
The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface Ordinary water tides are disregarded But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit This in turn sets off an alarm notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress Such equipment has been installed at Hilo Midway Attu and Dutch Harbor The moment the alarm goes off information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu which is the center of the warning system
This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami By means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps All of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly
Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific but only one was of any consequence On November 4 1952 an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula At 17:07 that afternoon Greenwich time the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu The warning system immediately went into action Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska Arizona and California the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time
It turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor knocked down telephone lines marooned automobiles flooded lawns killed six cows But not a single human life was lost and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000 There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage
But it is plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves
The key to the world of geology is change nothing remains the same Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man The land too is changing and earthquakes are daily reminders of this Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface often the shifts be seen but they are there and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried Today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them
The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized even overemphasized The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins and that it in turn has a solid inner core
Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface but they do not occur at greater depths Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts 1 As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking as rigid surface rocks do 2 If earthquakes do occur at such depths why not deeper
Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields In the search for oil and gas we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate
The following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes Of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet
The restless earth and its interior At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday April 18 1906 San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll

In Ireland's County Limerick near the River Shannon there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen which means Garden of Owen Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name The cry Garryowen Bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes Sioux and Apaches Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa Japanese in the South Pacific and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment The Fighting Seventh
Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism for in the modern Army esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables But tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh especially in a saloon on Saturday night
Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th Cav perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler Wiry and burr-headed with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper The truth is however that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil
Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer he managed to get transferred to the combat forces The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop H 7th Cavalry in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan
Outside of combat he have landed in a tougher spot First of all no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside especially when an armchair trooper Second if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him on maneuvers In combat helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed But in maneuvers with the top brass watching him all the time easy
Chandler understood this and expected the worst But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice Instead Sergeant Early was quiet sharp and confident He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work Further he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses He not only knew soldiering but mathematics history and literature as well
But for all his erudite confidence Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh That saved Mel Chandler Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment For example it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn
It take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop Aj But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it for the good of the troop and the regiment
Maneuvers over the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo Captain Chandler still with them It was the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor But still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word Garryowen The final proof was a small incident
It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each beaming above the biggest greenest shamrock he had ever seen The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding his wife and their two children And when the singing began it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best
Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin Goulding the Jewish officer from Chicago singing tearfully about the ould sod no one really thought it was strange For Marvin Goulding like Giovanni Martini the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message or Margarito Lopez the one-man Army on Leyte was a Garryowen through and through It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment
And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment One of his innovations was to see to it that every man cook and clerk as well as rifleman qualified with every weapon in the troop Even the mess sergeant Bill Brown a dapper cocky transfer from an airborne division went out on the range
The troop received a new leader Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status Carroll was sharp and military but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth and he wanted to play it cool So Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen just as he himself had been sold a short time before
When the Korean war began on June 25 1950 the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2 the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2
Just a month after the Korean War broke out the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines ready for combat From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea
One night on the Naktong River Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side The troopers knew an attack was coming but they know when and they know where At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12 they were in doubt no longer Then it came against Troop Aj
The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men armed with Russian machine guns attacked the position held by Chandler's men They came in waves First came the cannon fodder white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram They were followed by crack North Korean troops who mounted one charge after another They overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers over piles of their own dead
Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength He assembled a group of 25 men composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation the company clerk supply men cooks and drivers and led them to the hill One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll the young officer bucking for the Regular Army Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight
Then Mel Chandler started up the hill He took one step two broke into a trot and then into a run The first thing he knew the words Garryowen Burst from his throat His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran
The Koreans fell back but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire Chandler looking to right and left to see how his men were faring suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran It was Bob Carroll who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen He had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire
Enemy reinforcements came pouring down seeking a soft spot They found it at the junction between Troops H and G and prepared to counterattack Marvin Goulding saw what was happening He turned to his platoon Okay men he said Follow me Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward Garryowen On his lips his men following But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead For an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that their lieutenant the most popular officer in the regiment was dead Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and cursing screaming and hollering Garryowen They charged into the enemy like wild men
That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds
Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade he lived Today he is a major in the Regular Army
So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment After years of digging nights and weekends he put together the big profusely illustrated book Of Garryowen And Glory which is probably the most complete history of any military unit
The battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment
Take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876 From the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him But when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux refused to say a harsh word against him He was a member of The Fighting Seventh
Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history the regiment was ten years old by then Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry De La Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare
During the Civil War Custer who achieved a brilliant record was made brigadier general at the age of 23
He finished the war as a major general commanding a full division and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U.S. Army

I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident in the sense that everyone agrees with them If they were Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about I do mean however that I take them for granted and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions Assumption 1
The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity and in particular since this is our special responsibility that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States I speak of the largest possible measure because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved ever reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings and is therefore a dangerous man to have around Assumption 2
These conditions are unobtainable are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated without the prior defeat of world Communism This is true for two reasons because Communism is both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these conditions and because Communists have the will and as long as Soviet power remains intact the capacity to prevent their realization Moreover as Communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote Assumption 3
It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant proximate goal of American policy Proximate in the sense that there are more distant more positive ends we seek to which victory over Communism is but a means But dominant in the sense that every other objective no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it Peace is a worthy objective but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin then we must fight Freedom in the sense of self-determination is a worthy objective but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit then Algerian freedom must be postponed Justice is a worthy objective but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer Prosperity is a worthy objective but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made It may be of course that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world the absence of Soviet Communist power
The uses of power This much having been said the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do defeat Communism and if so how those resources ought to be used This brings us squarely to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power I submit that this is the key problem of international relations that it always has been that it always will be And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 to deal with this problem realistically and seriously
In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus One was demonstrably false the other for the most part true
The first was that America had become or was in danger of becoming a second-rate military power I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment I certainly do but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth Suppose he says that the tables were turned and we were in the Soviets' position There would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast Half of the population of the U.S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength
If we look at the situation this way we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries or at least of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage
U.S. prestige The other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign but once that has been done I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it
The argument was typically advanced in terms of U.S. prestige Prestige however is only a minor part of the problem and even then it is a concept that can be highly misleading Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you well or ill But contrary to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important for its own sake Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be The thing to lose sleep over is what people having concluded that we are weaker than we are are likely to do about it
The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead This ignorant estimate I repeat is not of any interest in itself but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side To the extent then that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation there is reason for concern
Still these guesses about the outcome of the struggle be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves Here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power of influence if you will about which the relevant questions are Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be
Communist gains In answering these questions we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence
Communist political warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes in mob uprisings in the streets in parliaments in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators at the United Nations on the propaganda front at diplomatic conferences preferably at the highest level
The Soviets understand moreover that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West Thus typically the first stage of a Communist takeover is to neutralize a country The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of neutralist while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy And this may be as far as the process will go The Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture not of Ghana but of the United States and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a neutralist mask yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office
To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring
Six years ago French Indochina though in troubie was in the Western camp Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-Communist neutralism Cambodia is for all practical purposes neutralist
Indonesia in the early days of the Republic leaned toward the West Today Sukarno's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists and for all of its neutralist pretensions it is a firm ally of Soviet policy
Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West
In the Middle East Iraq Syria and Egypt were a short while ago in the Western camp Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West Today Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging it would seem into the Soviet orbit
Latin America was once an area as safe for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon Today it is up for grabs One Latin American country Cuba has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast In some countries the trend has gone further than others Mexico Panama and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism and there is no country save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged where Castroism and Anti-Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause
Only in Europe have our lines remained firm and there only on the surface The strains of neutralism are running strong notably in England and even in Germany
Opportunities missed What have we to show by way of counter-successes We have had opportunities clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned but did nothing about There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power in Guatemala And contrary to what has been said recently we did not wait for outside pressures and world opinion to bring down that Communist government we moved decisively to effect an Anti-Communist coup We served our national interests and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery

The first rattle of the machine guns at 7:10 in the evening roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear
Sounds exactly like last time The young man spoke steadily enough but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven The middle-aged man said over and over Why did I come here why did I come here Then he was sick Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons I heard the thumping of mortars Then the lights went out
This was my second day in Vientiane the administrative capital of Laos and my thoughts were none too brave Where was my flashlight Where should I go To my room Better stay in the hotel lobby where the walls looked good and thick
Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby A woman with a small boy slipped in between them Please she said please She held out her hand to show that she had money
The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office But what was the story Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane
play hero I said go to the roof and see
Gunfire saves the moon By 7:50 the answer was plain There had been an eclipse of the moon A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad and the remedy was to make all possible noise ideally with firearms
The din was successful too for just before the moon disappeared the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again which meant good luck all around
How quaint it all seemed the next day A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons who became excited and left without paying their checks But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later And no wonder for Vientiane the old City of Sandalwood had become the City of Bullet Holes
I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door What had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick
This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days December 9-11 1960 And now in March all Laos suffered a state of siege The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death
And all the more tragic because so little deserved said Mr. J. J. A. Frans a Belgian official of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U.N. flag
Practically all the people of Laos he explained about two million of them are rice farmers and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages with an average of 200 souls Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are They spread over an area no larger than Oregon yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians
Life must be kept in harmony What matters here is family loyalty faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis the spirits and to live in harmony with nature
Harmony in Laos Precisely said Mr. Frans He spoke of the season of dryness and dust brought by the monsoon from the northeast in harmony with the season of rain and mud brought by the monsoon from the southwest The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River Shy slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside Even life in harmony with death For so long as death was not violent it was natural and to be welcomed making a funeral a feast
To many a Frenchman they came 95 years ago colonized and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe The Pathet Lao stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam were supplied by Soviet aircraft The Royal Lao Army on the other hand was paid and equipped with American funds In six years U.S. aid had amounted to more than $1.60 for each American a total of three hundred million dollars
We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants Even if it did not how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns
To find out we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled in the daytime at least by the Royal Lao Army from Attopeu the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast to Muong Sing the City of Lions in the northwest close to Communist China map page 250 We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts all four wheels spinning uselessly We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they crash In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire
We were Bill Garrett of the National Geographic Illustrations Staff whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met Boun My our interpreter and myself
Boun My the name means one who has a boun a celebration and is therefore lucky was born in Savannakhet the Border of Paradise He had attended three universities in the United States But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane including the royal capital Luang Prabang Before the airplanes came he said travel in Laos was just about impossible
Prime minister moves fast Alas so it almost proved for us too To go outside the few cities required permits And getting them seemed a life's work Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured and few soldiers could be spared as escorts
We were told that to the Pathet Lao a kidnaped American was worth at least $750 a fortune in Laos Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village as evidence of evil American intervention
Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in Vientiane with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French we were getting nowhere We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister Could we be ready in 15 minutes His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town and he was eager to be off
Prince wears ten-gallon hat And so after a flight southeast to Savannakhet we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas From his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger
The temperature rose to 105-degrees With our company of soldiers we made one long column of reddish dust
In Keng Kok the City of Silkworms the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas and two notebooks for me Then we drove on until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields bouncing across their squat earth walls
It was a spleen-crushing day An hour of bouncing a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary More bouncing another stop a new house for teachers a new well Then off again rushing to keep up We were miserable
But our two Jeep mates Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver Pennsylvania were beaming under their coatings of dust Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century constructively Mr. Keo once a diplomat in Paris and Washington was Commissioner of Rural Affairs John an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics headed the rural development division of USOM the United States Operations Mission administering U.S. aid
What you see are self-help projects John said We ask the people what they want and they supply the labor We send shovels cement nails and corrugated iron for roofs That way they have an infirmary for $400 We have 2,500 such projects and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools Ask Mr. Keo
Mr. Keo agreed Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them he said Where there was no road they lived without one Now they learn that men can change their surroundings through their traditional village elders without violence a big step toward a modern state You might say we are in the nation-building business
In the villages people lined up to give us flowers Then came coconuts eggs and rice wine The Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks strode rapidly among the houses joked with the local soldiery and made a speech The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping he said but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself
Then we were off again We did it for three days
But our stumping tour of the south all misery Crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak on a raft with an outboard motor we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze Then we hung overboard in the water
Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song on the cool Bolovens Plateau The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song
Strings keep souls in place In the village of Soukhouma which means Peaceful we had a baci This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies It takes place in the household a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions for the traveler a wedding a newborn child the sick the New Year for any good purpose
The preparations were elaborate flowers candles incense sticks rice wine dozens of delicacies and pieces of white cotton string The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls page 261
The candles were lighted and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables I was careful to keep my feet the seat of the least worthy spirits from pointing at anyone's head where the worthiest spirits reside Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us
Next he addressed himself to our souls A man has 32 souls one for each part of the body Those souls like to wander off and must be called back
With the divinities present and our souls in place we were wished health happiness and power Then one after another the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists These were to be kept on to hold in the 32 souls
As we stepped out into the sunlight a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar We could see maggots moving
John said I have some antiseptic salve with me but too late for that

My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive a boy remarked It means that you have to get ahead When I pressed for a purely religious definition I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety interfaith good will and a small residue of ethnic loyalty
I like the tradition a girl said I like to follow the holidays when they come along But you have to worship in the traditional way You can communicate in your own way As I see it no real difference between being Jewish Catholic or Protestant
Another teen-ager remarked Most Jews believe in God but they believe in people in helping people Still another boy asserted To be a good Jew is to do no wrong to be a good person When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant the boy answered the same thing
This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad They discovered that although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in 30 per cent to get happiness for yourself 28 per cent and financial independence 21 per cent
Nevertheless most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple However they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy professing to believe in Judaism but in a moderate way One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews the twentieth century and they have to wear beards
The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds We were brought up that way was one statement which won general assent I want to show respect for my parents' religion was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism Still another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons since be living in a suburb
Intermarriage which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds When you marry you want to have things in common a girl said and hard when you marry someone with your own background
A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and in addition required kosher food Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as the only Orthodox girl in town This is no doubt inaccurate but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant
The older teens One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at large 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy In their first two years in high school Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams However in their junior and senior years they generally forego their athletic pursuits presumably in the interest of better academic achievement It is significant too that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed unlike the younger ones that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts
The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys The motivations for both sexes to be sure are different The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed One of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women It is they who read and make Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them
In upper teen Jewish life the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality People automatically assume that in college a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably However among the girls there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office in contradistinction to gentile factory workers and buttressed by a respectable income she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature
The lower-middle class college student One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York Chicago and Philadelphia
What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world
Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session can serve as a paradigm of the urban lower-middle class Jewish student
There is to begin an important sex difference Typically in a lower-middle class Jewish family a son will be sent to an out-of-town school if financial resources warrant it while the daughter will attend the local college There are two reasons for this First the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's Second the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town
Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school On the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status the out-of-town school At the same time there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates people of your own kind a girl remarked You have to watch what you say Of course I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people but I would want lots of Jewish kids there
For most Brooklyn College students college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing However a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping As long as home never grow up a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly They like it if I do anything away from home so much trouble I usually bother
For girls the overprotection is far more pervasive Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn College and demanded the low-down on a boy who was going out with his daughter The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field Under pressure from parents the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex
The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual First the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights Then with the new affluence there is actually a sallying forth into the wide wide world beyond the precincts of New York It is significant that the Catskills which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers a kind of summer suburb of New York no longer attracts them in great numbers except for those who work there as waiters bus boys or counselors in the day camps The great world beyond beckons But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places Fire Island Nantucket Westhampton Long Island for example tend to be homogeneously Jewish Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program a good number of students spend summers in Europe In general however the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith And acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years
Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory as much as the Bronx or Central Park West There are hordes of nubile young women there who prodded by their impatient mothers are determined to marry It is interesting that although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate Almost everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities and houses in the House Plan Association that have good news to impart These announcements are in effect advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings pinnings ringings engagements and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House
The Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models The Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion or even in nondescript working class manner as they are in the restrained button-down Ivy way The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town and eye shadow mascara and elaborate bouffant hairdos despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel are not unknown even in early morning classes
Among the boys there is very little bravado about drinking Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place The Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys

This should be used frequently but shaken before using For galled breasts the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste This could also be used for any other skin irritation Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts
Female troubles of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection one for hastening delayed menstruation The sufferer drinks tansy tea
Bruises burns cuts etc. occurred frequently on the frontier and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain Salted butter was another cure for bruises Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water the burn oozed watery fluid for many days and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts Another swore by vinegar baths for burns and still another recommended salted butter Butter salve or butter ointment was used for burns and for bruises as well This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil when it was cool the fat was skimmed off and bottled Cow's milk was another cure for burns and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly One man badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns The results were good but which treatment helped is still not known
To stop bleeding cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut even when on a knuckle if it was made by a rusty tool this would stop the flow and also prevent infection My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth over which she poured turpentine He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated there is scarcely a scar showing Tobacco was common first aid A chaw of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing One old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head His brother ran a mile to get the father when they reached the boy the father sliced a new plug of tobacco put the scalp back in place and covered the raw edges with the slices Then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place There was no cleaning or further care but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding and rue was an antiseptic Until quite recently sterile maggots could be bought to apply to a wound they would feed on its surface leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated
Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips or if these were not handy plain lard Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke Rabies were cured or prevented by madstones which the pioneer wore or carried In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in Norton County and one had been in the family for 200 years Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker
While nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose not long ago a nosebleed was simply that and treatment had little variation Since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack was usually first aid This might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck pressed on the upper lip or inserted into the nostril cotton was usually used in this last Nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life Or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears
Old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance Felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven pounding it fine and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part As the cloth dried more of the mixture was applied and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be killed
Insect bites were cured in many ways Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method get a bite spit on it was a proverb This was used also for bruises Yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings not long ago Denver Mud was most popular Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye they buried themselves in the victim's flesh Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made For wasp stings onion juice obtained by scraping an onion gave quick relief A handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water mud was sometimes used as well as soap Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings
Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days to keep them out of homes even in the 1900's was a chore Bed slats were washed in alum water legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate applied with a feather Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests At times pioneer children got lice in their hair A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the job
To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted A cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye As the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out Another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed the particle would then move toward the nose where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton
Shingles were cured by gentian an old drug used in combinations For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth Itching skin considered just nerves was eased by treating with whiskey and salt Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped To cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water They drank half a cup of this morning and night and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow Now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus used as well for chilblains Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves
Boils have always been a source of much trouble A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice Another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree steeped in water until it formed a sticky gummy solution This was also used for sores Another frequent pioneer difficulty caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots was corns One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or fire Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on
There were many cures for warts One young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments and strangely enough many warts did just that One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours tie it on the wart and wear it for a week A simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way I know this worked One person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily Another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave As the onion decayed so did the wart
Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub sore feet by calf's-foot an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous herb garden or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved Leg cramps one person tells me were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard This does give relief as I can testify One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps Pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient's waist
For sprains and swellings one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief

Except for the wine waiter in a restaurant always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one's dealer and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity the situation is ideal It may on occasion be anything but that However by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters and better yet whether he has a taste for wine Again by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad This is important because despite all the efforts of the French government an appreciable segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas
A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards or the best parts of them he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis The Grands Crus are expensive and even doting palates tire of them And certainly in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown There is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper Some of them are very delicious indeed and there are many good ones exported unfortunately along with others not so good and worse Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation steering ever from the known to the unknown are the requisites
Wine waiters are something else again especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal their importance mounts Most of them the world over operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof on the customer himself Now the drinking of wine and happily so is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the supply would dry up in no time at all This is the only valid and extenuating argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter A really good wine waiter is paradoxically the guardian and not the purveyor of his cellar against the Visigoths Faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence The one way to get around them short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money Only then perhaps will he reveal his jewels and his bargains
Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served This is especially true of red wines and a practice which though not always practicable is well worth the effort It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days but in terms of months and years it is fatal Wine stored for a long time should be on its side otherwise the cork dries and air enters to spoil it When stacking wine on its side in a bin care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork Fat bottles such as Burgundies have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper reclining posture Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine provided the eye has not already spotted it is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it if it smells of wine the bottle is probably all right if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion
Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this provided there are no sudden or frequent changes Prolonged vibration is also undesirable consequently one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces If one lives near a subway or an express parkway the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time Light especially daylight is always bad for wine
All in all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking many people go to extreme lengths in decanting chilling or warming or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this and to give fair warning where warning is due no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism But the fact remains that in most restaurants including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal A white wine already at cool cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator the former is far preferable in about fifteen minutes for those who live in a winter climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow Though by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time It may be a bit cold when poured but again as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should be served in a large tulip-shaped glass which is never filled more than half full In this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal or the course in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire This invariably effaces any wine's character and drives its fragrance underground
It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles less fast in full bottles slowly in Magnums and slower yet in Tregnums double Magnums Jeroboams Methuselahs and Imperiales respectively Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration and any red wine brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncorked and allowed some air But white wines never White wines should be opened when served having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness Thus Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine especially a dry wine and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive
The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air To quote Professor Saintsbury The last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first but the first glass of Chateau or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last This does not mean though that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration there is a reasonable limit and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day after they have once been opened are never as good If this must be done they should always be corked and kept in a cool place it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk
A few red wines notably those of the Beaujolais are better consumed at cellar temperature By tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature if anything a little cooler and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well Thus red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward
Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table without disturbing the sediment Another school frowns on such a shortcut and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle
In France when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines one visits the restaurant well ahead of time chooses the wines and with the advice of the manager and his chef builds the menu around them The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and perhaps in the case of very old wines be decanted Decanting old wine aerates it fully it may also be practically speaking a matter of good economy For in the process of decanting the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table hence a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs
Though there are many exceptions which we have noted in preceding pages white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old and red wines nowadays between three and ten Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number red Burgundy Some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age or even more If a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid or cloying and muddy-tasting leave it alone for a while Most of the wines of Beaujolais on the other hand should be drunk while very young and Alsatians may be

Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically Rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views
Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer An excellent crop was expected that year William who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year Giffen advised acceptance of this plan citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation If sold then the land and improvements might bring only $5,000 Early in January 1844 he had a conference with Henry and William in New Orleans and upon learning of Gorham's intention Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs he contended but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation and Louisiana law required their removal from the state Gorham refused to accept money for slave property but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves Henry hid his annoyance although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother William who did not write to Gorham told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year he would sue amicably to protect his interests
Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation If William wished to continue operations for a year why not simply leave the Negroes undisturbed and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme Their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement When he heard of his brothers' anger Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages If not he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim William was adamant on one point under no circumstances would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once and then send them on to Liberia Lacking specific instructions he agreed to William's condition
In March there was a division of the slaves and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible Of the fifty-two slaves Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty twelve of whom were females I considered that your views would be best carried out he explained by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice The ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five for an old house servant to an unnamed newborn child If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited This cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper devoid of compassion or humanity was all he needed Each human being known only by a given name had a cash value Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150
Rose a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential was worth $400 In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property Palfrey was giving up close to $7,000
Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66 Thus twenty black souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men Giffen extracted one concession from William the house servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient
Despite Giffen's warning Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana Yet even if he could get the necessary approval fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special permission According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement Otherwise freedom would mean removal from the state in which as the place of their past residence from birth or for many years it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain On March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition News of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair and that it would reach the Ears of the People on the Plantation and make them restless & unhappy
His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself to free his slaves and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue When Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey Gorham readily assented vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him
In view of these difficulties Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana Giffen had already urged him to journey south if only for a few days to clear up matters His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again
During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists In both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North In New York Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man Mrs. Child who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately At Lexington Kentucky Palfrey consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject but with no apparent result
Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial Instead of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark on whom I had no sort of claim & have had many more invitations than I could accept He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of the marked attention and civility with which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him The memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas many of whom were coarse & passionate people much excited by what they heard of my plans He proceeded with his task bravely in his memoirs at least before the passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high
Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men but not the women to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom The women by remaining behind condemned their children born and unborn to bondage He had a short private talk with each adult slave Only one objected but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season so that they could get in their own little produce Palfrey agreed the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account William's threat that under no conditions would he allow freedom-conscious slaves to mix with his own was not carried out for the plantation continued in operation as before Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience
From Cambridge Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves In fact as the time for their departure approached his solicitousness increased Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier Giffen was to provide passage at once When a sailing date of March 1845 was finally established Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard ship Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 The plantation was sold in January 1845 and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement
On March 21 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation
Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot Giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves all more than fifty years old with the St. Martin's Parish Police Jury After an initial rejection which he attributed to a general Excitement against Abolition and Emancipation Giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury and got the permission without further delay
When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were of course no longer slaves Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 which declared all men are born free and equal Nevertheless Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free
Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the Hopedale Community but he had better luck in his other attempts Mrs. Child true to her word helped place Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named Hathaway near Canandaigua New York This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad health and her children were too young to work for their keep

But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest Secretary of State Dean Rusk a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean has headed the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange One of his initial acts in office was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs In the late forties and fifties Coombs has declared in defining his role two strong new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm aimed at the development of people at the fuller realization of their creative human potential and a better understanding among them
Many of the new appointees are art collectors Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include Renoir Cezanne Gauguin Van Gogh Toulouse-Lautrec Degas Matisse Picasso and Walt Kuhn The Director of the Peace Corps R. Sargent Shriver Jr. a Kennedy brother-in-law collects heavily among the moderns including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet Femmes dans un Jardin
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara former President of the Ford Motor Company comes from a generation different from that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson who had been head of General Motors Unlike Wilson who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism McNamara is the scholar-businessman An inveterate reader of books he chose while working in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann Arbor almost forty miles away He selected as Comptroller of Defense not a veteran accountant but a former Rhodes Scholar Charles Hitch who is author of a study on The Economics Of Defense In The Nuclear Age

Two men show promise of playing prominent roles
William Walton a writer-turned-painter has been a long-time friend of the President They arrived in Washington about the same time during the early postwar years Kennedy as the young Congressman from Massachusetts Walton after a wartime stint with Time-Life to become bureau chief for The New Republic Both lived in Georgetown were unattached and shared an active social life Walton who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days Nonetheless they found common interests During last year's campaign Kennedy asked Walton an utter novice in organization politics to assist him Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important New York City
Walton who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's paratroopers during the invasion of France combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy He provoked outraged editorials when after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House with Mrs. Kennedy he remarked to reporters We just cased the joint to see what was there But his credentials are impeccable Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the renovation of Lafayette Square A man of great talent he will continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter strictly ex officio for culture
A more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior Udall who comes from one of the Mormon first-families of Arizona is a bluff plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as C. P. Snow Arnold Toynbee and Aaron Copland
Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves After promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members members of Congress and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium The event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration
His Ideas in this respect however sometimes arouse critical response One tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum would be sent on indefinite loan to Salem Illinois Bryan's birthplace Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form They dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a Congressman decrying the more than two hundred statues monuments and memorials which dot the Washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans Hoping to cut down on such works Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized
He is not likely to win this battle easily In the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to hustle it out of Washington The last Congress adopted seven bills for memorials including one to Taras Shevchenko the Ukrainian poet laureate eleven others were introduced Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac and TR.'s own living children who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches and promptly dubbed by one of its critics Instant Stonehenge is another of Udall's headaches since as supervisor of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility for building it
Washington President Kennedy has been heard to remark ironically is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm There have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation commencing with the White House One of Mrs. Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces few of them authentic or aesthetic
Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk hewed from the timbers of the British ship H.M.S. Resolute and presented to President Hayes by Queen Victoria It now serves the President in his oval office Later browsing in an old issue of the Gazette Beaux-Arts she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe She traced it to a storage room With its coating of gold radiator paint removed a gaucherie of some earlier tenant it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House
But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture which Mrs. Kennedy feels is the proper period for the White House must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them Her effort to put the home of living Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes no party lines By rough estimate her Committee headed by Henry Francis Du Pont contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats
The press releases emanating from the White House give a clue to the activity within A curator has been appointed A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein and now hangs in the Blue Room The American Institute of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library Secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire furniture including Dolley Madison's own sofa to furnish a room in that style And part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs. Margaret Thompson Biddle has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the State dining room
Woman's place is in the home man must attend to matters of the yard One of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House Congress had already appropriated money and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the marble monumentality of government office buildings While a Senator Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater as well as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses all scheduled for razing
What to do about it now that he was President Only a few days after moving into the White House Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to him with instructions to work out what was best provided it pile unnecessary burdens on the President
The situation involved some political perils One of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged Court of Claims diagonally across the street from the White House Logically it should be moved downtown But Judge Marvin Jones senior member of the Court is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk to work More importantly he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn Speaker of the House
There were aesthetic problems as well as political On delving deeper Walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified as early nondescript The old Belasco Theater over which many people had grown sentimental was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a USO Center The Dolley Madison House Walton concluded was scarcely worth preserving The attempt to save the Square's historic value he declares came half a century too late

Surrounded by ancient elms the campus is spacious and beautiful The buildings are mostly Georgian The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion as he once did But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go far even though he may go fast for sophisticated pleasures He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence if he chooses to be
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment No one here pokes fun at manly virtues And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League It even affects the faculty
Thus when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival widely recognized as the greatest wildest roaringest college weekend anywhere any time was broadcast over a national television hookup Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl President Dickey's golden retriever frolicking in the snow at his feet added to the picture of masculine informality
This carefree disdain for side cropped up again in the same television broadcast Dean Thaddeus Seymour wearing ski clothes was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head So he kissed her No Dartmouth man was surprised
Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid For example groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River This is in honor of John Ledyard class of 1773 who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today They are hailed by the nation's press and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses
Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country
Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter starting with their own front door They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him or move out to Oak Hill where a lift The Dartmouth Skiway at Holt's Ledge ten miles north of the campus has one of the best terrains in the East ranging from novice to expert
Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke Dartmouth's own mountain Here at the Ravine Lodge President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails The Lodge built of hand-hewn virgin spruce can handle fifty people for dining sleeping or lounging in its huge living room The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters extending from the Vermont hills just across the river from the college through Hanover to the College Grant 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country The cabins are equipped with bunks blankets and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips The club runs regular trips to the cabins but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting fishing climbing or skiing
Under the auspices of the Outing Club Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club which takes on tough climbs like Mount McKinley and Bait & Bullet whose interests are self-evident and even sports a Woodman's Team which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping canoe races and the like
There is much to be said for a college that while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game deer or even bear is not uncommon City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp And on the summit of Mount Washington where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas because it is there
There is much to be said for such a college and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly Their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather specially Hanoverian
Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States Early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university It fixed on Dartmouth College which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered The legislators decided to liberate Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms faculty and chapel For a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body
The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters A lawyer hired by the college was arguing specifically for Dartmouth Daniel Webster class of 1801 made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea In an age of oratory he was the king of orators and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly tears as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax
It is sir as I have said a small college and yet there are those who love it
Dartmouth is today still a small college and still a private one thanks to Webster's eloquence
This is not out of keeping with its origins probably the most humble of any in the Ivy group Eleazar Wheelock a Presbyterian minister founded the school in 1769 naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth its sponsor and benefactor Eleazar pausing on the Hanover plain found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall a log hut dedicated for the education & instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others
It was a hardy undertaking and Wheelock's was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness A road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771 The governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college
The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings A student orator produced tears from a great number of the learned even before the punch was served Then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman disdaining both the platform and the English language harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines and a barrel of rum was broached The cook got drunk and President Wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself
Future commencements were more decorous perhaps but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace By the end of the nineteenth century in 1893 when the Big Three Columbia and Penn were populous centers of learning Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine The dormitories including the beloved Dartmouth Hall could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion
Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college By 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107 And at his last commencement in that year Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college The presidents of Cornell Wisconsin C.C.N.Y. Bowdoin Vermont Brown Columbia Princeton Yale and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there
Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools
It is still a college only and not a university it is in fact the only college in the Ivy group However three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums the Dartmouth Medical School third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 the Thayer School of Engineering and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration All three are purposely kept small with a current total enrollment of about two hundred
All three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and like the college proper place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study Students of the college who are candidates for the A.B. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way after a boy wins a B.S. in engineering
So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group It is still however the junior member of the League if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed However much football has been over-emphasized the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard so while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition
It has come on with a rush in more significant areas Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes and although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage they make for lively copy
President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an aristocracy of brains in Hanover

The person who left the buggy there has never been identified It was a busy street conveniently near the shopping center and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside
There are of course many weaknesses in any case against Emma She like her stepmother but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels If she avoided the train and hired a buggy the stableman might have recognized her If police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated she would be completely eliminated as a suspect
Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him although he clearly intended to stay overnight if not longer
Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door even though it was a very hot day
It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips A few years ago not too long before his death Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day information which must have come from Lizzie It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door
The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton as saying long after the trial that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse he would have convicted somebody Notice Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden He said he would have convicted somebody
It is known that Morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at Westport a town not far from Fall River They were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters Fall River police did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men These officers found no incriminating information
Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed He said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar The woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner Fall River is not a fashionable town The dinner hour there was twelve noon If this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days It is possible that Morse told the woman it was 11:20 but it could have been earlier since she did serve dinner on time Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger Questioned further Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him The conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made so Morse's statement really proved nothing
We do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying more than a mile away He met nobody he knew on this walk There is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed
Morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room Mrs. Borden told the servant Bridget I want you to wash these windows today Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction She said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows This was long after Morse had left the house
Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there He knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone And despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum this was not true The screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back It was unlocked all the time she was washing windows Morse could have returned openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand He had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out He could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar
If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return he could have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr. Borden came home With Lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to the house With the second murder over he could have left hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door was odd There was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains and certainly no scientific test was made of them And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed
The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders
On the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying The time would have been shortly after the murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior He said he had promised Mrs. Borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden house
What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay He wrote
The police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge Neither had any interest in the deaths indeed it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive Both he and Bridget were exonerated by Lizzie herself That was his complete discussion of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect
Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie said and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did he happily accepted her statement about Bridget as the whole truth He felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl
The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration but Lizzie's expression of her opinion as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet This officer had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse and she replied she think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them Fleet asked the same question about Bridget and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her
Lizzie actually never named any suspect She told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner And much as she detested Hiram Harrington she also did not accuse him At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward or who had bad feelings toward her father She replied I know of one man that has not been friendly with him They have not been friendly for years Asked who this was she named Harrington Her statement certainly was true the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer
When I interviewed Kirby who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard I asked if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders He said he had not heard of anybody else How about Bridget Sullivan I inquired Oh she was just the maid there he replied waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was Kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders
Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan
All the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers True it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations
The actions of Bridget should be examined since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her innocence There are also other factors that require closer examination
The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a big bundle of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to the detriment of Lizzie If Bridget did get any bundles of cash the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden
Bridget was born in Ireland one of fourteen children She was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time She worked as a domestic first in Newport for a year and then in South Bethlehem Pennsylvania for another year She finally settled in Fall River and after being employed for a time by a Mrs. Reed was hired by the Bordens
I have previously described how during the week of the murder Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes

Her father James Upton was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port A gentleman of the old school Mr. Upton possessed intellectual power ample means and withal was a devoted Christian The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests
There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind She possessed an observant eye a retentive memory and a critical faculty When she was nine years old she wrote a description of a store she had visited She named 48 items and said there were many more things which it would take too long to write An essay on Freedom written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence the freedom given to slaves in Canada and the views of George Washington
Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges only Oberlin and Elmira were open to women and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied
A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate Albert S. Flint friend of her brother Winslow and later like Winslow a noted astronomer He recalled Lucy as a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this With four younger children at home Lucy stepped into her mother's role and even after the brothers and sisters were grown she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in 1879 But even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits When her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University in 1874 she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under Professor Diman What is Prof. Diman's definition of civilization and take the world through is its progress ever onward or does it retrograde at times Do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do perhaps two weeks behind you And that she proceeded to do
Many years later on August 3 1915 Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from Smith College While I love botany which after dabbling in for years I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing Whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite study Mathematics came next
Her study of history was persistently pursued She read Maitland's Dark Ages which I enjoyed very much La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages 16 chapters of Bryce and liked it more and more more chapters of Guizot Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone
Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies She played chess with him by postcard Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in importunately Who won is not revealed but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words
There was another family interest also Winslow had musical talents as had his father before him At different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist And it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College
Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory For three years he was connected with the U.S. Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps and after 1883 was professor of astronomy at Brown University The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun of which he was a member took him to Colorado Virginia and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia After her father's death Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington D.C. Their house writes Albert S. Flint was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful to one like myself far from home Lucy was a lively part of the household Moreover she had physical as well as mental vigor Winslow as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall used to characterize her as our iron sister There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college As a matter of fact Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that her physical strength her mental power her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country
While in Washington D.C. Lucy Upton held positions in the U.S. Census Office and in the Pension Bureau They were not sufficiently challenging however and she resigned in 1887 to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study After the months in Europe she returned to Boston and became active in church and community life
What was called an accidental meeting with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman Here was a cause she believed in After correspondence with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles she came to Atlanta in the fall of 1888 to help wherever needed although there was then no money available to pay her a salary She served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance
Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students of her great power of discernment of her exquisiteness of dress her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers her great love of flowers and plants and birds and her close knowledge of individual students
She drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them to make them at home in the world and as graduates gratefully recall she drew on her purse as well Many a student was able to remain at Spelman only because of her unobtrusive help
Under Miss Upton the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption After all she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888 and had been since 1891 except for one year Associate Principal or Dean She had taught classes in botany astronomy with the aid of a telescope geometry and psychology
Miss Upton and Miss Packard as a matter of fact had many tastes in common Both had eager and inquiring minds and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and Christian zeal Both loved the out-of-doors including mountain climbing and horseback riding In 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard it was Miss Upton who planned the trip and with rare executive ability bore the brunt of the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end So strenuous it was physically with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton Yet they thrived on it
At the Fifteenth Anniversary 1896 as already quoted Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons When Dr. Wallace Buttrick wise in his judgment of people declined to have the Science Building named for him he wrote Miss Tapley April 7 1923 If you had asked me I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton Her services to the School for many years were of a very high character and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her
Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles
At the meeting of the Board of Trustees on March 3 1910 Miss Upton presented the annual report of the President She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired and the spontaneous praise demonstration held afterward on the campus were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles With the Fund in hand the debt on the boilers had been paid Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated walks laid and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results
Two bequests were recorded one of $200 under the will of Mrs. Harriet A. Copp of Los Angeles and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of Hamilton New York a friend from the early days
Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was the sorest grief the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear The daughters of Spelman she said had never known or thought of Spelman without her The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow but they still had Miss Giles Now the school was indeed bereft Yet Spelman has strong deep roots and will live for the blessing of generations to come
Miss Mary Jane Packard Sophia's half-sister became ill in March 1910 and when school closed she was unable to travel to Massachusetts She remained in Atlanta through June and July she died on August sixth
Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885 Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period But she decided to stay at Spelman She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years the catalogues show that she had classes in geography rhetoric and bookkeeping Soon the office work claimed all her time She was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships Quiet and energetic cheerful and calm she too was a power in the development of the seminary Miss Giles always used to refer to her as Sister She served as secretary in the Seminary office for 25 years and was in charge of correspondence records and bookkeeping The books of the school hold a memorial to her and so do the hearts of students and of teachers
Mary J. Packard states a Messenger editorial was efficient pains-taking self-effacing loving radiating the spirit of her Master With infinite patience she responded to every call no matter at what cost to herself and to her all went for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer

In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis usually at night perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics carpentry drafting electrical work tool-and-die work and sheet-metal work
Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation The diversified occupations program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers The distributive education program operates in a similar way with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half He receives remuneration for his work In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student while still in school to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation
Adult education courses work-study programs of various sorts these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth In general however it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next If the student drops out of high school the break with the school is even more complete When there is employment opportunity for youth this arrangement or lack of arrangement works out quite well Indeed in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered He may or may not be better off than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent
In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools However the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities Quite the contrary as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president Rather we see here another vicious circle The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers I believe the situation is improving but the success stories need to be heavily publicized Here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press How can the vicious circle be broken This is a problem to which leaders of opinion both Negro and white should devote far more attention It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South
Vocational education I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education First and foremost vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation Second vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years however for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier Third the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time Fourth the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few if any graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training the whole idea of relevance disappears Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school chore for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter Those who because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience
I have been using the word vocational as a layman would at first sight think it should be used I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls These courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective academic Practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school To be sure in tool-and-die work and in the building trades the first job must be often on an apprentice basis but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status Similarly a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school Of course it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill So too is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation which may be a profession will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained In spite of the shading of one type of course into another I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school
Most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools In this respect public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts The neighborhood high schools are not strictly speaking comprehensive schools because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school Indeed one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs He prefers to designate such schools as general high schools The suburban high school it is worth noting also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report
The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment except for a lucky few One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy just say I want to be a plumber and then by doing good work find a job It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind One vocational instructor in a city vocational school speaking of his course in a certain field said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city In the city he said the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he get in In a far distant part of the United States I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work What does he have in mind to do when he graduates Oh be a plumber came the answer But it almost impossible to get into the union I asked have no difficulty I was told He has very good connections
In my view there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest
An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing bricklaying carpentry cabinet making auto mechanics and airplane mechanics The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils

The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world In the United States where half of the world crop is grown soybeans are processed for their edible oil The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds
Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient American chemists seeking to increase exports of soybeans have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia Soybean flour grits flakes milk and curd can be bought in the United States
Peanuts are the world's second most important legume They are used mainly for their oil We produce peanut oil but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed Blanched peanuts as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off
Cereal grains supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa
In western Europe and North America where the level of economic development is higher grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed Rather meat and potatoes sugar and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate protein oils and fats People depend less on seeds for foods in Australia New Zealand and Argentina where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle and the consumption of meat is high
Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's cereal crop in 1957-1958 Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry About 90 percent of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals The rest is used for human food and industrial products More than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock
More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the United States
The efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil
The demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position
Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds flax castor tung nuts from the China wood-oil tree perilla from an Oriental mint and oiticica from a Brazilian tree
Oils or liquid fats from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal These oils develop hard smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances
The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds
Seeds of soybean cotton corn sesame and rape yield semidrying oils Some are used in paints along with drying oils Palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin
Castor oil made from castorbeans has gone out of style as a medicine This nondrying oil however is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment and as a source of chemicals to make plastics
Almond oil another nondrying oil was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances It is still used in drugs and cosmetics but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds
Liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives
Sizable amounts of soybean coconut and palm kernel oil seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes also are used to make soaps detergents and paint resins
Solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree the shea tree and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries
Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States Canada and Australia In other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch Starch is used in the paper textile and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations
Gums were extracted from quince psyllium fleawort flax and locust carob seeds in ancient times Today the yearly import into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds of psyllium seed more than 2.6 million The discovery during the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the United States
Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners stabilizers or dispersing agents Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance psyllium was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper
The seeds of hard fibrous stony fruits called nuts provide highly concentrated foods oils and other materials of value Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick adherent brown covering the seedcoat
The kernels of brazil nuts cashews coconuts filberts hazelnuts hickory nuts pecans walnuts and pine nuts are predominantly oily Almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein Chestnuts are starchy All nut kernels are rich in protein
The world production of familiar seed nuts almonds brazil nuts filberts and the English walnuts totals about 300 thousand tons annually
Coconuts the fruit of the coconut palm have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit World production of copra the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 Exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil
Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg the soap nut which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins the marking nut used for ink and varnish the aromatic sassafras nut of South America and the sweet-smelling cumara nut which is suited for perfumes
A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed It is used for making buttons and other small hard objects of turnery Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists
The color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations
Since Biblical times rosaries have been made from jobs-tears the seeds of an Asiatic grass Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry
Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year
Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids aromatic oils and highly flavored components Although science has given us more effective materials preparations from anise castorbean colchicum nux vomica mustard fennel and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons
Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection
Still another group of seeds sometimes tiny dry seed-bearing fruits provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible The common spices flavorings and condiments make up this group
Each year millions of pounds of anise caraway mustard celery and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported
Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family such as cumin dill fennel and angelica Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek artificial maple flavor and cardamom White pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit
Sesame seed which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt Brazil and Central America has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds It is a main flavoring for halvah the candy of the Middle East Sesame sticks a snack dip originated in the Southwest
Beverages are made from seeds the world over
Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree World production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons Per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the United States
Cocoa chocolate and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa 63 percent and South America 27 percent
Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America
Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain Arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India
Beer generally fermented from barley is an old alcoholic beverage Beer was brewed by the Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago Brewers today use corn rice and malted barley
Distillers use corn malt wheat grain sorghum and rye in making beverage alcohol
Seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the United States
The farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes including the cereals is nearly 10 billion dollars a year Cereal grains oilseeds and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised
The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn oats barley and sorghum as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed cottonseed and soybeans through conversion to poultry meat and dairy products
Seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock Hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed
Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain baking crushing oilseed refining edible oil brewing distilling and mixing feed
More than 11 thousand business establishments in the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 The value of products from these industries was 15.8 billion dollars of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes Not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products
Cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry

To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called locatin' 'em To keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called loose herdin' To hold 'em in a compact mass was close herdin' Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted That became their home range Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out seekin' grass and water These became strays the term bein' restricted to cattle however as hosses under like circumstances were spoken of as stray hosses not merely strays
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over You stop 'em you had to go with 'em or wait till the storm was over and follow Such marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a drift or winter drift and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals The single animal or a small bunch were referred to as strays but when a large number were bunched up or banded up and marched away from their home range as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a drift Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought or as an aftermath of a stampede Drifts usually happened only with cattle for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em and to find shelter for 'emselves
The wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards and sometimes droughts over a wide range of territory was called a die-up Followin' such an event there was usually a harvest of fallen hides and the ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons Cattle were said to be potted when blizzard choked that is caught in a corner or a draw or against a drift fence durin' a storm Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the winter kill When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to bow up This term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight as one cowhand was heard to say He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm Cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into prime beef were said to be double wintered
Cattle brought into a range from a distance were called immigrants Them new to the country were referred to as pilgrims This word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot Hereford cattle were often called white faces or open-face cattle and the old-time cowman gave the name of hothouse stock to them newly introduced cattle Because Holstein cattle a beef breed they were rarely seen on a ranch though one might be found now and then for the milk supply The cowboy called this breed of cattle magpies A cattaloe was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle Dry stock denoted regardless of age or sex such bovines as were givin' no milk A wet herd was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows while wet stuff referred to cows givin' milk The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a milk pitcher Cows givin' no milk were knowed as strippers The terminology of the range in speakin' of dry stock and wet stock was confusin' to the tenderfoot The most common reference to wet stock was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their rightful owners The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals Mixed herd meant a herd of mixed sexes while a straight steer herd was one composed entirely of steers and when the cowman spoke of mixed cattle he meant cattle of various grades ages and sexes
In the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass this was spoken of as turn-out time or put to grass Shootin' 'em out was gettin' cattle out of a corral onto the range When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to come out a-stoopin' To stir cattle up and get 'em heated and excited was to mustard the cattle and the act was called ginnin' 'em 'round or chousin' 'em After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called throwin' over
A cow rose from the ground rear end first By the time her hindquarters were in a standin' position her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude It was when she was in this position that the name prayin' cow was suggested to the cowboy They were said to be on their heads when grazin' On the hoof was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail Shippin' cattle by train was called a stock run A general classification given grass-fed cattle was grassers
When a cowboy spoke of dustin' a cow he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes The cow unlike a bull or steer kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin' and a cow on the prod or on the peck was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges
The Injun's name for beef was wohaw and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters Listenin' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted Whoa Haw and Gee they thought them words the names of the animals and began callin' cattle wohaws Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north that it stopped to receive demand for wohaw
Tailin' was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope Any animal could when travelin' fast be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin' the brute seizin' its tail and givin' the latter a pull to one side This throwed the animal off balance and over crash onto its head and shoulders Though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results many men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn supplemented sometimes in the case of cattle by a downward heave of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail Such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns and a thorough tailin' usually knocked the breath out of a steer and so dazed 'im that behave for the rest of the day It required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider When cattle became more valuable ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued at least when the boss was 'round When the cowboy used the word tailin's he meant stragglers
Bull tailin' was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas From a pen of wild bulls one would be released and with much yellin' a take after 'im Seizin' the bull by the tail he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side throwin' the bull off balance and bustin' 'im with terrific force Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called peggin'
Colors of cattle came in for their special names An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a brindle or brockle A lineback was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' down its back while a lobo stripe was the white yeller or brown stripe runnin' down the back from neck to tail a characteristic of many Spanish cattle A mealynose was a cow or steer of the longhorn type with lines and dots of a color the rest of its body 'round the eyes face and nose Such an animal was said to be mealynosed Sabinas was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin' The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail Sonora reds while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico yaks because they came from the Yaqui Injun country or gave 'em the name of Mexican buckskins Near the southern border cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback with white speckles frequently appearin' on the sides and belly were called zorrillas This word was from the Spanish meanin' polecat Yeller bellies were cattle of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color An animal with distinct coloration or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders was sometimes used as a marker Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler
Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it mix with the uncounted cattle was called a range count The countin' of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a pasture count The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle and drifted it back so that it get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead This method of countin' was usually done at the request and in the presence of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as cattle paper
A book count was the sellin' of cattle by the books commonly resorted to in the early days sometimes much to the profit of the seller This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the books freeze This became a common byword durin' the boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin His saloon was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen and one year durin' a severe blizzard when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces he said Cheer up boys whatever happens the books freeze In this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count and created a sayin' which has survived through the years Range delivery meant that the buyer after examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation for truthfulness paid for what the seller claimed to own then rode out and tried to find it
When a cowhand said that a man had good cow sense he meant to pay 'im a high compliment No matter by what name cattle were called there was no denyin' that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest
21 swingin' a wide loop the first use of the word rustler was as a synonym for hustler becomin' an established term for any person who was active pushin' and bustlin' in any enterprise Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler and when the order was given to go out and rustle the hosses it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in Eventually herdin' the hosses was spoken of as hoss rustlin' and the wrangler was called the hoss rustler Later the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief startin' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to get out and rustle a few mavericks

It was John who found the lion tracks He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before and he circled once nose to the ground hair shooting up along his back as it did when he was after lion or bear and then he lifted his head and bayed and the pack joined in all heads high and Jones knew it was a hot trail
He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet honeycombed with caves top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass On the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly
Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs and Means and Loveless had taken another route and now with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him Ulyate reined in in the shadow of the Reef and pointed Kearton focussed his field glasses
the Colonel he said But I see the dogs
As they watched Jones rode straight for the Reef Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him The dogs were working a trail lion Hyena The pack had made a bend to the north swinging back toward the Reef and Kearton and Ulyate could hear them faintly
Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party
Not yet cautioned Ulyate
Jones came toward them fast now along the southern toe of the Reef and the dogs could be heard plainly Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others There was Sounder too also a veteran of the North Rim and Rastus and the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds and a collie from a London pound and Simba a terrier A motley pack chosen for effectiveness not beauty Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down cheering them on
Light it Ulyate said and Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass blew on it and flame licked out He threw green stuff on it and a thin blue column of smoke rose
That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we are
Two quick shots sounded Then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying Then the heavy roar of a lion
Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away At the base of the rocky hillside they left their horses and climbed on foot The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks creepers and bushes so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called Ulyate answered from ten feet away Nice country to meet a lion in face to face Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion till they came out of breath to the crest and peering through the branches of a bush this is what Ulyate saw Jones who had apparently and actually had ridden up the nearly impassable hillside sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him while the dogs whirled around her
Ulyate drew back with a start and put finger to lips almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off The dogs have got her bayed just the other side of that bush And when they had drawn back a step he added Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her Why she charge him I know And he even got a knife on him He get away from her in this kind of ground Careful disturb her
Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared opening her mouth wide lashing her tail and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation as much as to say How dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct
Intuition told him however that she was tired and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge yet He moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her being careful because he knew the female is less predictable than the male In the graveyard at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso Of the thirty-four seventeen had been killed by lions and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses She snarled terribly but intuition told him again that she was bluffing and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs He threw the lasso It was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock Even then if she took one step forward he could catch her But John nipped her rear end one lion's rear end was as good as another to John Africa Arizona no matter and she changed ends and took a swipe at John but he ducked back
Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her She whirled and faced him roaring terribly and Ulyate watching through the leaves could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him because he have much of a chance of getting away in that thick growth but she seemed just a trace uncertain while Jones on the other hand appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer
From the lioness' point of view this strange creature on the back of another creature lashing out with its long thin paw very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with But now she sank lower to the rock Her roar changed to a growl Her tail no longer lashed Although she appeared more subdued and defeated Jones knew she was growing more dangerous She was rested and could mount a charge Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet
At this moment Loveless and Means arrived crashing through the undergrowth with their horses and distracted her and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John
got to get her out of there Jones yelled or kill 'em all Bring me the firecrackers
For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of their equipment Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed
she a beauty though Called out Means as she ran
you go a step nearer her than I do Jones warned and if you do go at a run so have momentum
For two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the Reef trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw But she clung to the rocks and brush and the day wore away It was hot The dogs were tired The men were tired too It was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again And the sun was beginning to go down If dark came they would lose her
get a pole Jones said finally and poke a noose over her head
At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef Ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago not the gentler ones of today and this one was angry with good reason Loveless too objected It work Colonel
Just the same try it
But without waiting for them to try it she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain
John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind many of them trailing blood John himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail but he was in this fight to the finish running almost as strongly now as in the morning
She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully crouched at the base of a thorn tree and waited for them to come up She had chosen the spot well With the gully on three sides she could be approached only along the tongue of land Careful now Jones warned
Means tried her first Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding edging closer watching for a chance to throw but ready to spin and run rope whining about his head horse edging tensely under him but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion They tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion but these
Means edged closer She snarled warningly Means spit and edged on Again she snarled and again he edged The pony was sidewise to her With a whirling jump it could get into gear However nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance unless it was a cheetah
She charged Means spun and spurred For thirty yards she gained rapidly She was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay but and here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth she never quite caught up that last bound Means held steady one jump ahead of her Then gradually he began to pull away A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion from a standing start Photos showed later that been about six feet from Means Of course the factor of head start made all the difference How much head start No one knew exactly That was the whole question Enough was the answer
The lioness quickly changed front when she saw she catch Means and made for Jones As she had done with Means she gained rapidly at first but then Baldy began to draw away Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point
When Jones too drew away she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully crouched low and waited as before This new position however gave the ropers a better chance There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went So Means edged around on the north side of her Jones moved in from the south Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention He succeeded almost too well because once she rose as if to charge and he half wheeled his horse he was within fifty feet but she sank back
From behind her Means shot forward at a run Kearton began shouting Wait wait the jammed But Means kept on He raced by within twenty feet of her roped her around the neck but a lioness' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off

The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life The Christian education of children too was once hardly more than a sideshow but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty
The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives Most pastors and laymen even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the ecclesiastical Rover Boys as someone has dubbed them who like to go to national and international assemblies and have expense accounts that permit them to do so
As long as this point of view prevails the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community Progress will take place far less through what is done in any summit conference of the National Council or the World Council or even in offices of the denominational boards than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side Until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes programs and relationships it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality As things now stand there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation
The ecumenical congregation The crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community The decisive question is what happens within each congregation and finally in the minds and hearts of the individual members It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical
It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the grass roots This way of describing the matter is unfortunate It implies two misconceptions One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only to be understood at the so-called lower levels The truth however is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections now comprehended by many national leaders can be communicated to all congregations However needed this may be the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world
The basic unit in the church of whatever denominational polity is always the congregation It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much Most people do not realize that the congregation as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another is unique The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation but Hinduism Buddhism Islam Confucianism Taoism Shintoism although they have sacred scriptures priests spiritual disciplines and places of prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship
How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ It is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom on the level of merely human agreeableness we might prefer not to have any association at all There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building
Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists The local and the ecumenical are one
Of course the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other Neither is adequate if it stands alone Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other And this is what all too often happens
Divergent perspectives A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones They were bifocals He often spoke of them as his ecumenical glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church It is he said a bifocal vision which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both
As things stand now the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other On the one hand there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy Likewise the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship pastoral service and counseling and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals
On the other hand many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission As a result they go on thinking of the church with introverted and self-centered satisfaction only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world
The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards It is growing in numbers Its people are agreeable friends It has a beautiful edifice Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled It helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible It draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is
But what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa
To put it bluntly many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world
There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community He built a school and a library then a recreation center and an inn Desiring to fill the only remaining lack he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired Do you belong to this church Mr. Rancher Why no ma'am he replied this church belongs to me The story reflects the way too many people feel As long as the congregation regards the church as our church or the minister thinks of it as my church just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ and that it is His purpose not our own interests and preferences that determines what it is to be and do
Local embodiment of the whole A local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ
Yet the truth according to the New Testament is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place

Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap
This was a bitterly fought game carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd Every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink they dropped many called forth yelps of derision
At one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was dead or the base runners were free to score
This was typical of such games which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship When the visitors after losing this game rode along the village streets toward home the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly You bunch of hay-shakers back home You hay-shakers
Baseball was surely the national game in those days even though professional baseball may have been merely a business Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home in the town park or a pasture with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox
Young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places even if they failed to make the major leagues Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three I League or the Pony League or the Coastal Plains League or the fast Eastern League if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores that played two or three times a week throughout the summer usually in the cool of the evening before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each or even more to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over
Babe Ruth of course was everyone's hero and everyone knew him even though relatively few ever saw him play ball His face was always in the newspapers sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life As the twenties grew older and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals the great hitters always led by Babe Ruth overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to choke up on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done
Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth who was still called Jidge by all his friends or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least and who called most of the world Kid Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs But the nickname never stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in color which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field Ruth was a delinquent boy still but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it
A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities with the encouragement of the press so that they might see their names in big black print along with Daddy Browning's Al Capone's Earl Sande's and the Prince of Wales' One who for a time succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires who called himself in the newspapers Art the Great or The Great Shires It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything but especially at fighting and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager The sorry fact about this young man who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being never so good as he claimed and always an irritant to his associates but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public
In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down or who ingested strange objects like live fish or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor with or without a partner or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath One young man exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army football game landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below and died at once
But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments and performers thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher prospered too While fifty years before Albert Goodwill Spalding secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox all of them top performers in their positions had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year stars now were asking ten thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars yes even fifty thousand dollars a season
The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire Ruth himself still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers had led the parade down from Fenway Park followed by pitchers Carl Mays Leslie Joe Bush Waite Hoyt Herb Pennock and Sam Jones catcher Wally Schang third baseman Joe Dugan who completed the playboy trio of Ruth Dugan and Hoyt and shortstop Everett Scott By 1926 when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field Mark Koenig Lou Gehrig George Pipgras and gray-thatched Earl Combs The deeds of this team through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall Babe Ruth as he always did in the Stadium played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes and Tommy Thevenow a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers where Ruth could not reach it The ball lay there shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth red-necked with frustration charged about the small patch of ground screaming the -ing ball But as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me so little Tommy ran all the way home
The ordinary man and woman however saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days or of any other sporting event for that matter Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance Radio broadcasts however now that even plain people could afford loud speakers on their sets held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones chiefly women who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition became first inured then attracted then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies some of which began to offer special excursion rates including seats at the park just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new
While women had always attended ball games in small numbers it was the part of a dead game sport in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root root root for the home team they had often sat in patient martyrdom unable even to read the scoreboard which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one The questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy as were the doings of women automobile drivers for every grown man except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility knew at least the fundamentals of baseball just as every male American in this era liked to imagine or pretend that he could fight with his fists And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball
Radio however so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have Ladies' Days any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears
The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative despite the baseball jargon that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school

This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the ideal and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal
Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of identity vs. identity diffusion as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers We hope thereby to emphasize that from a psychological standpoint the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence
Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle during adolescence the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend to a considerable degree on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy childhood and early adolescence Within Erikson's schema the adolescent's delinquent behavior in this case her unwed motherhood reflects her identity diffusion or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively
The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion Time perspective the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives is more easily developed if from infancy on the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives Erikson has noted that unless this trust developed early the time ambivalence experienced in varying degree and temporarily by all adolescents as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately
These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters Some of these mothers apparently feeling a desperate urgency made on the spur of the moment commitments in love and sex that would have life-long consequences Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future For many of these unwed mothers the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general
However as Erickson has noted the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his or her adolescence And as shown in Chapter 6 some SNP females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence through the aid of and their identification with alter-parents In the specific case of time diffusion we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most if not all adolescents in our society and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust
The adolescent experiences two closely related crises self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness and role-experimentation vs. negative identity A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity is more easily developed during adolescence if during early childhood the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy
However if the child has been constantly surrounded during nursery and early school age by peer groups inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity sensitivity and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable will be compounded Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations in her adolescence of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to and judged by the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends To be different is to invite shame and doubt and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents who already consider one different and difficult to understand than by one's peers who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status
The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self
Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy initiative and self-discipline during childhood The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks having kept commitments and having created something however small or simple even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought to be These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs for experimenting with many roles and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities
If she has not had such experiences the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives e.g. whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study Erikson has noted that as this indecision mounts it may result in a paralysis of workmanship This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting and never completing many jobs tasks and courses of study and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work college carreer and studies on what others are doing rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills abilities likes and dislikes The absence during her childhood and early adolescence of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting
The comments made by some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 reflect this paralysis of workmanship They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made they accepted a job primarily because it was available convenient and paid reasonably These things both express and at the same time continue contributing to their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty As their identity diffusion increased they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship no sense of dignity derived from a job well done
Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance though through different facets of experience For example some unwed mothers had had no work experiences household chores and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting Sex was both On the other hand some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior
The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data
Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values to perceive things as either-or black or white nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant This tendency is perhaps most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood It provides identification with an idea a value a cause that cuts through or even transcends the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion
The positive development during adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas values and practices depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy initiative and self-certainty Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed however in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty
A pronounced ideological diffusion i.e. inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems is reflected in many ways For example it is evinced by the adolescent or adult whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others rather than his inner conviction and choice It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment In another sense it is represented in the arguments of the true believers who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs
The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior For example the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong and they censured parents who never disciplined and were too permissive or who never explained how easy it was to get pregnant
In the adult world there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis For example some contemporary writing tends to fuse the good guys and the bad guys to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue and to explain or even justify asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological familial and social experiences

In the final accounting these would have augmented the bill for both sides An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive
Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation which many regarded as wasteful indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure The duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions The suit as we have seen came before the courts when patent attorneys inventors and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the American patent system Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity
In a long and angry footnote to his opinion Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism It is a duty said Hough not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity current in this circuit and probably others excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court especially to be found in patent causes and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity Observing that reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record the duplication of testimony and exhibits the numerous squabbles over minor matters the objections stated at outrageous length and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts uncalled for and unjustifiable from the retort discourteous to the lie direct
The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was a striking though not singular example concluded Hough will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present and responsible for the maintenance of discipline and the reception or exclusion of testimony
Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a horrible example Its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House
Parker who agreed with much of this criticism did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects But he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried In a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912 he remarked that loose statements about the case showed scant understanding of the facts The suit although commonly designated as a single action actually embraced five cases Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony
In a private communication written in 1911 Parker had been more to the point Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar he admitted that some of the strictures were fairly well founded but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit as well as the complex character of the automotive art encouraged both sides to exploit every possible chance for or against the patent said Parker This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur
Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony The taking of depositions he suggested should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course been pursued it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that
In the end Hough's acidulous protest which Parker called the now somewhat famous note on this Selden case did not go unheeded In 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1 1913 The revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform Under the new rules testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity limit delays and reduce the expense of infringement suits One of the A.L.A.M. lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone could have been contained in one volume While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit
3 Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 the A.L.A.M. was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.L.A.M. were more representative for they never adopted a policy of exclusion Nevertheless it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation Its origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath
From the earliest days of the motor car industry before the A.L.A.M. was established patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories among them tires detachable rims ball bearings license brackets and electric horns The fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims As early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers This scheme failed and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912
In this tangle of conflicting claims the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.L.A.M. patent pool although it did not protect them against outside actions and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M. members Within its limits this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly Since the A.L.A.M. holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M. pool But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model T and earlier cars and in 1905 as a precautionary measure took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor
For those affiliated with it the A.L.A.M. pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions It was commonplace for auto makers parts-suppliers and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail Purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view commented a trade journal the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications One manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits The prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions including delays surrounding legal disputes particularly in patent litigation are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste
By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information At this point Charles C. Hanch long an advocate of patent peace in the industry became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce successor to the Automobile Board of Trade Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904 He had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal but Hanch did not abandon his scheme
After the demise of the A.L.A.M. the time was propitious for establishing such a pool Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned said a trade authority than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day
With the other members of the patents committee Wilfred C. Leland Howard E. Coffin Windsor T. White and W. H. Vandervoort Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution The plan was supported by Frederick P. Fish counsel for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce It will be recalled that in his summation for the A.L.A.M. before Judge Hough Fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial community He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making he later told a Congressional committee The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association
Drawn up in 1914 the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915 It remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925

A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina called the Pearl of the Aventine Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome If you look through the keyhole you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio a street lined with stately homes Oleanders cypress and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section Turn left a block or so before the street ends and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city
The renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon These two walks take you through the heart of Rome You will walk some of the narrow old streets hemmed in by massive palazzi You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed a magnificent square the main shopping district the Spanish Steps and the lovely Pincian Gardens By seeing such varied places both interesting and beautiful you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through and in particular get a feel of Renaissance Rome You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City
Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C. Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days Andrea Palladio an Italian architect of the sixteenth century modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns
Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei Here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome the Fontana delle Tartarughe or Fountain of the Tortoises typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement
Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei one of Rome's oldest palaces now the headquarters of the Italo-American Association Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance palace In the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall The Palazzo Caetani still inhabited by the Caetani family adjoins the Palazzo Mattei
Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami cross the wide Via Arenula and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling Follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State Paintings by Titian Caravaggio and Rubens are on display open 9:30 to 4:00
Before you enter the palazzo note Francesco Borromini's facade The great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death if so the statue once stood in the senate house This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning
By tipping the porter you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance yet it is actually only a few feet away The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front The gardens of the palazzo shaded by a huge magnolia tree are most attractive The courtyard is magnificently decorated
From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it Today it is occupied by the French Embassy Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling can be seen Sundays 11:00 to 12:00 noon Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat
Directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome Today by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit vegetable and flower market Continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle As you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated The dome of the church is outside of St. Peter's one of the largest in Rome Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca
At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona one of the truly glorious sights in Rome
Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains its two churches that almost face each other and its russet-colored buildings is a sense of restful spaciousness particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk
The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium which was probably used for horse and chariot races For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages
Giovanni Bernini's Fountain of the Rivers in the center of the piazza is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks with four huge figures one at each corner denoting four great rivers from different continents the Danube the Ganges the Nile and the Plate The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone the work of Bernini's rival Borromini
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit have a drink or lunch and watch the fountains in the square The scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch
Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone next to the church and opposite the center of the square then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo The church's cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations
Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale in a moment cross the Corso Del Rinascimento In front of you is the Palazzo Madama once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate Walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda You are now facing the Pantheon the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient Rome
This circular edifice constructed by Agrippa in B.C. 27 was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor Hadrian It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns
The Pantheon's interior still in its original form is truly majestic and an architectural triumph Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome Standing before the tomb of Raphael the great genius of the Renaissance when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome
As you leave the Pantheon take the narrow street to the right the Via Del Seminario a block to Sant' Ignazio one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city Along the way there about one hundred yards on your right you pass a simple restaurant La Sacrestia where you can have the best pizza in Rome The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set This is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome One block along the Via De Burro in front of the church will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune A few yards farther on the Via Dei Bergamaschi is the Piazza Colonna The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius
You are now at the Corso though narrow one of Rome's busiest streets Horse races took place here in the Middle Ages
If you have taken this stroll in the morning and you have the time and inclination walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the Palazzo Doria open Sunday Tuesday and Thursday 10:00 to 1:00 Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives
Otherwise cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left You will come to Alemagna a delightful though moderately expensive restaurant which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries Either here or in one of the modest restaurants nearby is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome To the Spanish steps The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best

Rare indeed is the Harlem citizen from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence injustice or brutality I myself have witnessed and endured it more than once The businessmen and racketeers also have a story And so do the prostitutes And this is not perhaps the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen nor the reasons according to Harlem that they are nearly all downtown
It is hard on the other hand to blame the policeman blank good-natured thoughtless and insuperably innocent for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves He too believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed He has never himself done anything for which to be hated which of us has and yet he is facing daily and nightly people who would gladly see him dead and he knows it There is no way for him not to know it there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent accumulating contempt and hatred of a people He moves through Harlem therefore like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country which is precisely what and where he is and is the reason he walks in twos and threes And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company the people who are watching him know why too Any street meeting sacred or secular which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination And these days of course in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant it speaks of the end of that domination The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world He is not prepared for it naturally nobody is and what is possibly much more to the point he is exposed as few white people are to the anguish of the black people around him Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination something must seep in He avoid observing that some of the children in spite of their color remind him of children he has known and loved perhaps even of his own children He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature He becomes more callous the population becomes more hostile the situation grows more tense and the police force is increased One day to everyone's astonishment someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed editorials speeches and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land demanding to know what happened What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men
Negroes want to be treated like men a perfectly straightforward statement containing only seven words People who have mastered Kant Hegel Shakespeare Marx Freud and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable The idea seems to threaten profound barely conscious assumptions A kind of panic paralyzes their features as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South My recital disturbed him and made him indignant and he asked me in perfect innocence Why all the Negroes in the South move North I tried to explain what has happened unfailingly whenever a significant body of Negroes move North They do not escape Jim Crow they merely encounter another not-less-deadly variety They do not move to Chicago they move to the South Side they do not move to New York they move to Harlem The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand and this expansion is always violent White people hold the line as long as they can and in as many ways as they can from verbal intimidation to physical violence But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto The white people fall back bitterly before the black horde the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent chopping up the rooms and all but dispensing with the upkeep and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a turf This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands and the bitterness thus caused is as I write being fought out all up and down those streets
Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War and won they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South without taking any responsibility for it and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse Well in the first place it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is worse I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners because At least there you got to play any guessing games The guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward the madhouse or the river I know another Negro a man very dear to me who says with conviction and with truth The spirit of the South is the spirit of America He was born in the North and did his military training in the South He did not as far as I can gather find the South worse he found it if anything all too familiar In the second place though even if Birmingham is worse no doubt Johannesburg South Africa beats it by several miles and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world The world has never lacked for horrifying examples but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes This perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling The emptier our hearts become the greater will be our crimes Thirdly the South is not merely an embarrassingly backward region but a part of this country and what happens there concerns every one of us
As far as the color problem is concerned there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner the Southerner remembers historically and in his own psyche a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him Historically the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War Personally it is the Southerner's sexual coming of age when without any warning unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past Everything thereafter is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need The resulting indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria
None of this is true for the Northerner Negroes represent nothing to him personally except perhaps the dangers of carnality He never sees Negroes Southerners see them all the time Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else Negroes are therefore ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South and suffer hideously in both places Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward in which case we are told how many Negroes comparatively bought Cadillacs last year and how few comparatively were lynched or as a victim in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change change until the North changes The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom In the meantime generations keep being born bitterness is increased by incompetence pride and folly and the world shrinks around us
It is a terrible an inexorable law that one deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own in the face of one's victim one sees oneself Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we this nation have become
4 East River downtown postscript to a letter from Harlem
the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans Stevenson's speech and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery were both touched off by the death in Katanga the day before of Patrice Lumumba Stevenson stated in the course of his address that the United States was against colonialism God knows what the African nations who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were thinking they may for example have been thinking of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking I had intended to be there myself It was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death I was curious about the impact of this political assassination on Negroes in Harlem for Lumumba had has captured the popular imagination there I was curious to know if Lumumba's death which is surely among the most sinister of recent events would elicit from our side anything more than the usual well-meaning rhetoric And I was curious about the African reaction
However the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.N. gallery Had I been there I too in the eyes of most Americans would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists The climate and the events of the last decade and the steady pressure of the cold war have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination and so it has been decided that the riots were Communist inspired Nor was it long naturally before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community
According then to what I take to be the prevailing view these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs
I find this view amazing It is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict One has only for example to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions The first question is Would I like to live here And the second question is Why those who now live here move out The answer to both questions is immediately obvious Unless one takes refuge in the theory however disguised that Negroes are somehow different from white people I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability
Now I do not doubt that among the people at the U.N. that day there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives Wherever there is great social discontent these people are sooner or later to be found Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity What I find appalling and really dangerous is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult implying as it does that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated

Color was delayed until 1935 the wide screen until the early fifties
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties Each film consisted of fifty feet which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen As long as audiences came to see the movement there seemed little reason to adventure further Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square Brief snips of actual events were shown parades dances street scenes The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity a train rushes straight at the audience or a great wave threatens to break over the seats An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary Queen Of Scots The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold the headsman swung his axe the head dropped off end of film An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage
In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded one-minute shows In response the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries art films and travelogues despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama the movies are at heart a form of fiction like the play the novel or the short story Moreover the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men a French magician Georges Melies and an American employee of Edison Edwin S. Porter Of the two Porter is justly the better known for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film toward making the motion picture the intricate efficient time machine that it has remained since even in the most inept hands
Narrative time and film time Melies however out of his professional instincts as a magician discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film One of these is the dissolve which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene As the first scene begins to fade the succeeding scene begins to appear For a moment or two both scenes are present simultaneously one growing weaker one growing stronger In a series of fairy tales and fantasies Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story with beginning middle and end complications resolutions climaxes and conclusions Immediately the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time Physically a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing Linking the smoothly changing images together the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement The projection time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions So is the time of the novel The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time but the time is fixed by the director and the players the conductor and the instrumentalists subject therefore to much variation as record collectors well know The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely The film consists of a series of still transparent photographs or frames 35-mm.-wide Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen at the rate for silent movies of 16 frames per second and for sound films 24 frames per second This is the rate of projection it is also the rate of photographing Time is built into the motion picture which exist without time Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative which is at its simplest the story of an action with usually a beginning a middle and an end elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence The moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is to be sure more intense than a still picture of the same subject but the difference is really one of degree the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo In narrative time is essential as it is in film Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling magician's tricks produced on film
It was Porter however who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable Overnight for one thing Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film One reel from eight to twelve minutes became the standard length from the year of Robbery 1903 until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915 The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies
The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it good guys and bad guys in the old West pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's A band of robbers enters a railroad station overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator holds up the train and escapes A posse is formed and pursues the robbers who having made their escape are whooping it up with some wild wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out The robbers run from the hide-out take cover in a wooded declivity and are shot dead by the posse As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience
All this is simple enough but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before Each scene is shot straight through as had been the universal custom from a camera fixed in a single position but in the outdoor scenes especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws Porter's camera position breaks necessarily with the camera position standard until then which had been roughly that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen If the change at first sight seems minor we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change and the Italian painters by universal consent were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device
He did more than that He revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic technique in the art of the film Cutting of course takes place automatically in the creation of a film The meaning of the word is quite physical to begin with The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence and the cut edge is joined physically by cement to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence If as a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps you have merely recorded an historical event If in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event you have begun to be an artist in film you are employing the basic technique of film you are cutting
This is what Porter did As the robbers leave the looted train the film suddenly cuts back to the station where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor She dashes around in alarm The two events are taking place at the same time Time and space have both become cinematic We leap from event to event including the formation of the posse even though the events in reality are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously and not near each other but at a considerable distance
The chase as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device The chase in itself is a narrative it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both The simple naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction The cowboy films the cops and robbers films and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence these films and these sequences are also seeking out instinctively or by design the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative
The creator of the art of the film D.W. Griffith There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art The man was D.W. Griffith When he came to the movies more or less by accident they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film
Not that there had not been attempts mostly European to do exactly that But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented Great actors and actresses the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera In all of this extensive and expensive effort the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author The phonograph today for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera Not surprisingly this approach did not work The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies

In general religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis congregational membership however is another thing A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership that is when it can preserve economic integration Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition
The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches Central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations 1 central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes 2 central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition The central city areas in other words exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents Central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities With few exceptions the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city
The key to Protestant development therefore is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes but this is deceptive for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood moreover residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship If it were primarily a believing fellowship it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks something which most congregations of the New Protestantism with a few notable exceptions have not been able to do They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers
The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the folksy spirit of Protestant religious life in fact a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the impersonal Roman Catholic parish We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers consequently the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations actually there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations as we shall see in another connection The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform therefore to the principle of economic integration This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members
Mission as co-optation The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations There is much talk in theological circles about the Church as Mission and the Church's Mission theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world A crucial question therefore is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism If economic integration really shapes congregational life then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration The task of a congregation would be defined according to economic integration as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization In a mobile society congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment this recruitment however must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation therefore the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation like elements will have to be assimilated
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches one study in Pittsburgh however has illuminated the situation In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial contacts with friendly members If we add to these contacts with friendly members the contacts with an organization of the church 11.2 per cent of the cases then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact On the surface this seems a sound approach to Christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people the new people respond in kind by joining the church
Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration once the pool of recruits diminishes the congregation is helpless friendly contacts no longer keep it going
The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities worship preaching and publicity in reaching new members The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy 17.3 per cent of new members and friendly contacts by members over two thirds if organizational activities are included Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members In general friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together the outer life of congregations the suitability of the environment to their survival will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance The expense of this type of organization in religious life when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society nonetheless the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized the schism between central city and suburb Negro and White blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment More than creatures of metropolitan forces the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples
Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis Consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests Negroes Puerto Ricans and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century The identification of the basic unit of religious organization the parish or congregation with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion
This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity since worship presupposes some local stabilities Whatever projection one makes the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people
Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman dictating the methods of child rearing determining the pattern of community participation setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness and informing the congregational life of the major denominations Fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly contact form the iron cage of denominational religion Its contents are another matter for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity
The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need

With capital largely squandered there seemed to them no other course to pursue
The directors sold directly to concessionaires who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages who might be habitants voyageurs or even soldiers The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships The company disposed of the pelts but with what profit the records do not show
In accord with its penurious policy the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men Traders from the English colonies were far more generous and Indian loyalty turned to them Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company
In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts In each of these there was to be a strong military post and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses For southeastern Louisiana Mobile was the principal post and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east in the region threatened by British traders Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River Fort Toulouse on the Alabama River had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws but money was available for only one other new post near the present Nashville Tennessee and this was soon abandoned
West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district of which New Orleans was headquarters Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain
On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west principally down the Arkansas River On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post at the fork of two great rivers Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri where there are mines in abundance
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director responsible to a director-general at New Orleans An elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way Concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires
Only two principal storehouses were actually established one at Mobile the other at New Orleans New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi and west of that river and on the Ohio and Wabash Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration be determined Regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body The Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and on its own authority sent to disaffected savages merchandise suitable for the peltry trade It decided also that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians
During the first administration of Bienville the peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue The Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts These deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods
During his first administration Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods of a kind to which they were accustomed to supply the Indian needs The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply De La Laude commander of the Alabama post had the friendship of the natives and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors Diron D'Artaguette the most prominent trader in the district was energetic and resourceful but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors He became after a time commander of a post on the Alabama River but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade
The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district Their territory lay to the north near the sources of the Alabama the Tombigbee the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them and did not make peace for four years Venturesome traders however continued to come to them from Mobile and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets British traders from South Carolina incited the Indians against the French and there developed French and British Factions in the tribe The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana To hold them was an essential part of French policy for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf
Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices His urgings brought some results The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country
The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians in order to drive back the Carolina traders was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 For two years his friend and cousin Boisbriant remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders and even kill some of them the Carolina advance continued
The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina and when Perier came over as governor in 1727 he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district But the Company of the Indies holding to its program of economy made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods and the prices charged the Indians They were to conciliate the unfriendly savages and wherever possible to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina They were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering Perier's intrigues gained some successes The savages divided into two factions one was British and the other French So hostile did these factions become that among the Choctaws civil war broke out
Perier's efforts however were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district and he decided to send troops into the troubled country He asked the government for two hundred soldiers who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians In spite of the company's restrictions he planned to build new posts in the territory He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts
No help came from the crown and Perier in desperation gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette D'Artaguette went vigorously to work and gave credit to many hunters But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts and soon French trade in the region was at an end Perier finally in one last bid in 1730 cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France The Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders who swarmed over the country almost to the Mississippi
With the loss of the Mobile trade which ended all profits from Louisiana the Natchez Indians revolted They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts In January 1731 the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an indemnity The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres Thenceforth the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen
Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications arms munitions or supplies The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families Others left the country and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade If this trade should be resumed the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans and soldiers discharged from the army must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois This was a slow and difficult course and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders These men were without capital or experience
Perier and Salmon the intendant wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts Bienville who returned to succeed Perier in 1732 objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits He reported too that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods He did find some to trust however and he employed the King's soldiers to trade With no company to interfere he kept close control over all the traders
In order to compete with English traders Bienville radically changed the price schedule The King should expect no profit and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France which would cover the expense of transportation and handling was all he charged the traders

They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman
The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available First the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department the Chamber of Commerce assaults upon the Treasury A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health Education and Welfare The congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write
With all these agencies the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger
In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson After all the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer the laborer or the businessman but to foreigners Not only do these foreigners not vote for American congressmen they are also probably ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty And are not the State Department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll Will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes The chances are excellent that he will
The result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers State keeps the junketeering list a secret
The Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion Congress is a harsh master State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition
But come the next session of Congress State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats The congressman who in Paris may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury
In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative John J. Rooney of Brooklyn who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence not with Nikita Khrushchev but with John Rooney Nothing worked In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around friendly persuasion groveling abasement pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps Rooney remained untouched
The trouble explained Loy Henderson then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do
One year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income News of the project reached the press Next day reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that that year expense allowances would not rise a dollar They
The Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate Armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back or on the head of the Secretary of State
With its power to investigate the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees as it did with Dean Acheson John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson who was then operating the Senate refused to let it become an Inquisition During Dulles's first two years in office while Republicans ran the Senate the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945
An internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod a former F.B.I. man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence was part of the vengeance So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow The principal mauler however was Senator Joseph McCarthy Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way
In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy In any event the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it He elected to get along
During this dark chapter in State Department history men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill Their old errors of judgment were equated in the curious logic of the time with present treasonous intent Their successors absorbing the lesson made it a point to have few ideas
This in turn brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control In the new style the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians For three or four years in the mid-1950's this complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon It became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself
An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation
Getting along with foreigners there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in Washington They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house to what Congressman Rooney has called that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians
Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini of the poseur the spy the party crasher and the patriot of the rented tails the double cross and the tired Lothario
Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty the secret of the anti-missile missile or an invitation to dinner Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington Some like the British and the French maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the American scene Other embassies cable home The New York Times without changing a comma
Each has its peculiar style The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin he made a determined effort to change this idea Menshikov hit Washington with a TV announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp To everyone's astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov
Where his predecessors had glowered Menshikov smiled Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers' assistants Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails Overnight he became the most available man in Washington Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club alike In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked Menshikov What should we call you And that Menshikov replied Just call me Mike
Smilin' Mike was the sobriquet Washington gave him His English was usable and he used it fearlessly Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried Up your bottom For a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods he was the sensation of Washington At the State Department hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas too had been able to smile
The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians usually end Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics Moscow resumed scowling and Smilin' Mike dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West
The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs' and the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians When King Saud visited Washington the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds The State Department was little help on this or on much else about Saudi Arabia A reporter who consulted a Middle East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company This is where I get my information from he confided But bring it right back the only copy got
The size of Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower When it ended a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American friendship to bore in on the central question How many children did the King have
Twenty-one replied the sheik
And how many of these were sons
Twenty-five the sheik replied
Do you mean to tell us a reporter asked that the King has twenty-one children twenty-five of whom are sons
The sheik smiled and murmured That is precisely correct
The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats including the Israeli Foreign Minister Mrs. Golda Meir Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions

The deep water is used by many people but it is always clean for the washing is done outside I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom
Of course most toilets are Eastern style at floor level but even when they are raised to chair height they are actually outside toilets inside A few newer homes have Western flush toilets but even with running water they are usually Eastern style
The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom Spiritual life is cultivated but students do not need to be Christian They have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates
In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers Mrs. Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about beautiful artistically talented an artful manager of her big household four boys and four girls and yet looking like a pampered gentle Japanese woman She was a real experience The dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination
Because Don was leaving the next day I spent the evening with him at Asia Center The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me and we went to visit schools kindergarten middle-school elementary school and high school Mr. Yoshimoto's school There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected some think too much
There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles but the younger people who have lost all faith and convictions are now parents There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure no certain guiding principles to give stability As a result money is spent quickly and freely with no thought of its value Gambling is everywhere especially among students Parents indulge their children
The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again for why should they It will be painful but interesting to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop
In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good They suggested several new foods and usually I found them good except the sweets which I think I could learn to like Six of the science teachers were present and we had great fun
Kyoto After a day at Nikko Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen but it was fun for once to be elegant I did explain to the students however that this was not my usual style for their salaries are very small and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well They understood and teased me a bit about it
I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto Nara and Hiroshima Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center It along with Nara was untouched by the war and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto Fumio's mother her son Mr. Washizu a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year and Mr. Nishima one of the science teachers I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens We visited the Okamoto home where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated They were even better than those of Tokyo more spectacular and more imaginative
After a supper of unagi rice with eel eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school They apologized for the condition including dirt and flies and I was a little at a loss to know what to say There seemed to be no excuse I have the answer yet
We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he too comes from a very wealthy family His grandfather is a Buddhist priest and he being the eldest was supposed to be a priest but he chose to do differently and one of his brothers is to become the priest This is a significant fact in Japan for only a few years ago he would have had no choice In his big home live four families and thirty people so it needs to be big Also there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old paintings lacquer brocade etc. He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum The house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older less-hurried times
Nara Osaka and Hiroshima Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara We passed his house and school on the way In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon A new red carpet had been laid for their coming but I walked on it too Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day we started out again to see Nara at night
In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima Again the plan was for me to go alone but they let me At Osaka Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night It is the second largest city in Japan with about four million people One spot in Osaka I shall always remember the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river In the midst of a great busy city people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light
My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 a.m. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand
I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I want to They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people who hold no grudge but who also regret Pearl Harbor I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan There were no words to say this but there was no need
The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming Hiroshima is a better city than it was before in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima
Tokyo On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university the Japanese Women's University This day was Open House for Parents day and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables Everything was in an exciting turmoil full of anticipation and fun
It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants Many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns
At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated Even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions
Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo Here the women learn to keep house as maids they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family They have model kitchens a sick room with a model patient in bed and a nursery with a life-like doll Although the training is only for one month it is intensive and thorough Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately Occasionally they return for additional training Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture clean corners and work effectively in keeping a shiny house Her education in the United States not just in a classroom but also in an American house with an American housekeeper stands her in good stead
University of Tokyo After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria the kitchen of which Masu had planned Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant

The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should of course be applauded But for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case The suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy Then the boycott would not be secondary but a primary one It would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which for love's sake and for the sake of justice must be removed and indivisible from this to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy Perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order by threatening potential injury to its entire economy to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument and therefore of questionable justification Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate Moreover prudence alone would indicate that unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company or even as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice to its going out of business in certain sections of the country as for that matter the Quakers who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue never to recover a large number of southern adherents
In any case anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national TV network on which was presented a drama showing it seemed a high yellow gal smooching with a white man It is true of course that the end or objective of this action was different But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice and since in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force
The need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means The end or aim of the action of course is also important especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights e.g. against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County Tennessee at the present moment Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled and to legal remedies This however is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict if both sides are strong enough can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used It is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just i.e. that if economic pressure has to be resorted to this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices while if injury fall upon others it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily however inevitably and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them
It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality like any other form of resistance The language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory perhaps to be chosen above all others One of the sit-in leaders has said Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom Everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them The present writer certainly agrees with that statement and would also affirm this in the order of justice However it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means R. B. Gregg has written that non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance He suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him and again that the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war namely to demoralize the opponent to break his will to destroy his confidence enthusiasm and hope In another respect it is dissimilar for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values
A trial of strength however is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent and in warfare with any means men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause This makes necessary a morality of means and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified The question then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression
Among Christian groups the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure Since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing The primary objective of non-violence writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist is not peace or obedience to the divine will but rather certain desired social changes for personal or class or national advantage Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance These principles we have now set forth Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted but clearly specified and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means and apply to both alike justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals There must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance violent or non-violent The justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good In these terms the economic withdrawal of the Negroes of Nashville Tennessee from trading in the center city for example was clearly justified since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out
We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above There may be instances in which if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa amounting to virtual slavery and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions Billions of American dollars not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers this author states are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression the persecution and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail This leads to the conclusion that the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue Our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord it seems with the moral conscience of America not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country but also in accord with our law U.S. Code Title 19 Section 1307 which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which this author believes must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation
