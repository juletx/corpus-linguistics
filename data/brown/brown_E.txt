Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents want sonny-boy to lift all those old barbell things because stunt your growth or because childish taunts from his schoolmates like Hey Mr. America do with all those muscles of which he has none at the time
After all a have a little ego
Therefore a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates
This happy always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada Henri De Courcy
Far from discouraging Henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority Professor Roland Claude
And they have entrusted Henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast fast muscle growth
because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other Gaetan D'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada Jean-Paul Senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago Jack Boissoneault who was with us last month Charles Harve who recently won the Most Muscular Man subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event and a host of others Yesiree the professor knows his muscles
Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight About that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein those two wonder-working Weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they could do for him
Well sir they did real great For in almost less time than it takes to tell it Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly Of course he did some exercising crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame
Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really have to work them very much But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body It was muscular but it symmetrical A real nothing torso says Henri It never seemed to widen It just got longer and longer
when he went to Professor Claude And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it In his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment since Vic Tanny Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or pushing movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group
So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous moon bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover the pull part of the Push-Pull Super-Set which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide Reeves-type gladiator pecs while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids
As you can see in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time
Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 2
Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done with dumbbells and using both moon and flat benches The push exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the Aj
The pull exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords
In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the push exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars while the pull exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved know when made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch As you see the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip He has to he just do anything about it at all
But as you can also see not a painful exercise at all because Henri De Courcy the happy bodybuilder looks as though he were having the time of his life
The last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets By this time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press note the high incline This gives a wide flare to the pecs causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and Aj
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock looks of the great champions
So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 four of No. 2 four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building muscle-shaping torso-defining workout that be improved upon
Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion superior definition of the muscles
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set high-rep light-weight workouts But contest definition that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel is something quite different This comes not alone from high-set high-rep training but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him
Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others Because they are minority exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten Only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are
The exercise I shall discuss in this the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part is the One Leg Lunge Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I say because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths
It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike the facet of muscular development that wins prizes
Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts
But for purely definition purposes used in conjunction with your regular Squatting Leg Curling Leg Extensor programs a heavy weight is not needed Indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater more extensive split can be performed Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin
Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1
a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise 2
It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition 3
It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed 4
It increases flexibility of the legs 5
It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated effort to be focused on each
need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and the way done 1
Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean 2
Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them grasp the bar which will rest against the back of your neck extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split
Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg without moving your feet When the front knee is straight and locked allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands 3
After you have taken a breather reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear and the rear thigh now to the front and perform the same movement in the same manner
the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise
Oh wobble and weave quite a bit at first But worry Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran
Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck no reason why you make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck Squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front

The most beautiful bed of pansies seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day Pansies are supposed to like it cool but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather He seemed puzzled by my question I just love them he said
The more I talked with him the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care He planted the pansy seeds himself buying them from a pansy specialist These specialists I learned have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants Occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did but pansy seeds he told me soon run down best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them
His soil was nothing special just prairie land but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose spongy and brown-black I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture tilth and body It easy to describe it but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies They germinate quickly the tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along lustily It really matter which month of the year you sow them but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours
I like to make a seedbed right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold frames Pansies have to be coddled rather have things rugged with only moderate protection on the coldest days If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting I dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray Then I cover the sowing with a board This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board A light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth I like sawdust for this or hay
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants time to set them out where they are to remain Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller The moral is transplant it any oftener than you must As soon as they are large enough to move I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant That encourages rooting and the better developed the roots the larger and more plentiful the flowers
Pansies are gluttons I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them I spade lots of compost into their bed lacking that decayed manure spread over the bed is fine One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile to which a little sand had been added and I had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my neighbors' experience In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week diluted to the color of weak tea As a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions may be used
They need mulch We put a light mulch over the seedlings now we must use a heavy one Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost That keeps in the cold retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing
miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days be likely to find a brave little blossom or two If those enough for you why not grow some just for winter blooming The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame An unheated greenhouse would have been better if I had had one The plants took zero nights in their stride with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them In response to the lengthening days of February they budded then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers That cold frame was my morale builder its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it Like strawberries in December pansies are far more exciting in February than in May Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just take another day of it
The day will come in midsummer when you find your plants becoming leggy running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby pin to hold it there Pick the flowers keep the soil dampened and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over cut it off from the mother plant
A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring I like to shear half my plants at a time leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed Nature's aim different from ours is to provide for the coming generation That done her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant
Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds Go to a reputable grower preferably a pansy specialist It is no harder to raise big healthy blooming plants than weak sickly little things in fact it is easier But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow
Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period of growth and bloom is over That is not true If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific than the first
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies Remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest with the largest buds The flowers will be huge
Pansies have character They stick to their principles insist upon their due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it Treat them right and make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones Give them food some shade mulch water and more food and repay your solicitude with beauty
A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal but add an avocado and you have something really special This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you made avocado a part of your diet yet you really should
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted It is roughly shaped like a large pear and when properly ripened its dark green skin covers a meaty melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear but oily The avocado should have a give to it as you hold it when it is ripe The flavor is neither sweet like a pear nor tart like an orange it is subtle and rather bland nut-like It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to not because it is unpleasant but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits Sometimes it takes several eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world Once you become an avocado fan you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation
Naturally dormant and no spray danger Today refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree but it is still firm at this point It is brought to packing houses cleaned and graded as to size and quality and packed in protective excelsior The fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-F. a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state This cooling does not change the avocado in any way it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature room temperature is restored This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen
One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed If the temperature is controlled properly the avocado will delay its ripening until needed And unlike other fruits one eat the skin of the avocado It is thick much like an egg plant's skin so that poison sprays if they are used present no hazard to the consumer
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer Good taste and versatility plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit even if its nutritional values were limited Avocados however are very rich in nutrients Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system Aside from this the average portion contains some protein an appreciable amount of vitamins A and C about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement and about a third of the official vitamin E requirement The B vitamins are well represented especially thiamin and riboflavin Calcium phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts None of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration storage
Dr. Wilson C. Grant of the Veterans' Administration Hospital Coral Gables Florida and the University of Miami School of Medicine set out to discover if avocados because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients The study comprised 16 male patients ranging in age from 27 to 72 They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol level of their blood Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption

Five four three two one fire The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear Nuclear weapons are fearsome but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people With a nation defenseless before it why would the attacker spare the victim's people the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation The nation would be utterly devastated The will of its people so crucial in time of peril would be broken
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities being soft and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons
However because this vulnerability is mutual it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic
ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways They could be used to attack a nation's people which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military force
If our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile
Missiles are very valuable weapons but they also have their too little known limitations
Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately Placing missiles in submarines on barges railroads highways surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of destruction select the missile to be fired against the target compute ballistics for the flight and prepare the missile for firing
Even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously the ICBM still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes Therefore if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered
Because of this it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability
In order to destroy the enemy's mobile moving or imprecisely located strategic forces we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us
It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ICBM force It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons
An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia provided that we had used some of our ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile fleeting and imprecisely located targets as well as the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile
Why then we planning a larger more important role for manned military aircraft Is there any other way to do the job
Survivability of our strategic forces Polaris mobile and hardened Minuteman hardened Atlas and Titan and airborne Skybolt means that it will take some time perhaps weeks to destroy a strategic force War under these circumstances be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation Forces will survive a surprise attack and these forces will give depth or considerable duration to the conflict
The forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed Even mobile forces must be found and destroyed But how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile
Some day many years in the future true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets But until we have an effective spacecraft the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft
However the aircraft which we have today are tied to large soft airfields Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease Here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing but the airfield on which the aircraft is completely dependent is doomed by the missile This makes today's aircraft a one-shot or one mission weapon Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile But remember this it the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets it is the airfield Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles
There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground
Put aircraft in bomb-proof hangars when they are on the ground
Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small 3,000-foot airfields with runways If we could use all the small airfields we have in this country we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more
Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life
Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing VTOL long-range military aircraft
We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 Aj We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters
Large long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways but they would require more powerful engines than we have today There is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile
This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft One seldom hears the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine
If for some reason such as economy we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one With powerplants such as these vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built For example a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic VTOL fighter With a 15-to-one engine a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise vertically The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars and you spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete
When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields they are no longer vulnerable to Aj If our SAC bombers were today capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again and again and again those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance
We would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force whether it were fixed or mobile With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating No need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy's military force
Our first necessity at the very outset of war is post-attack reconnaissance In a few years we will have SAMOS semiautomatic missile observation system But in the case of moving targets and targets which have limited mobility what will their location be when it is time to destroy them What targets have we successfully knocked out A ballistic missile today tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful What targets still remain to be hit These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds and to see in the dark
Even if this is some day possible there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target If the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced
Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the United States with the chance that the target if it were mobile would be gone
A large aircraft such as the B-52 or B-70 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 psi overpressure at 100 feet Or put another way the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead 1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki within 100 to 200 feet of the target
It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons
Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings runways taxi-ways separate spans of bridges etc. With these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas
If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening

The lyric beauties of Schubert's Trout Quintet its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers the work presents its problems Since it requires only five players it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music yet it calls for a double bass an instrument generally regarded as symphonic Moreover the piece is written in five movements rather than the conventional four of most quintets and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions with the contrabass given free rein Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation In these readings the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background or it is dressed in clown's attire the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances The occasion for this marathon Angel's long-awaited reissue in its Great Recordings Of The Century series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first
Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions COLH 40 is a document of prime importance Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of all time and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils Clifford Curzon Frank Glazer Adrian Aeschbacher and Victor Babin also sheds light on the master's pedagogical skills Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions most notably the Schnabel trill which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own
Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity his innate rhythmic vibrancy and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master and as a result the playing here has humor delicacy and radiant humanity This is a serious-minded interpretation but it is never strait-laced And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives
About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy I for one rather regret that Schnabel collaborate with the Budapest Quartet whose rugged athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group From a technical standpoint the string playing is good but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here The violinist in particular is very indulgent with swoops and slides and his tone is pinched and edgy The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the Forellen movement and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original Aj
Turning to the more modern versions Curzon's London offers the most sophisticated keyboard work Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out and of these I would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians and the gossamer shading throughout Some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky however Why for example does he favor two tempos rather than one for the third movement The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise but their contribution is rustic and appealing Special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp his scrawny tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition Concert-Disc is a model of lucidity and organization It is moreover a perfectly integrated ensemble effort But having lived with the disc for some time now I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's but the sound on his Decca disc is dated and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it
The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet Angel and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet RCA Victor editions give us superlative string playing both in symphonic style crippled by unimaginative piano playing Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner but his playing is of limited insight Badura-Skoda-Vienna Konzerthaus Westminster and Demus-Schubert Quartet Deutsche Grammophon are both warm-toned pleasantly lyrical but rather slack and tensionless Helmut Roloff playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble gives a sturdy reading in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound and this bargain-priced disc it sells for $2.98 is worthy of consideration
Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's musical penetration Here is truly a Great Recording of the Century and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect This recording surely belongs in everyone's collection Must records always sound like records
From the beginning of commercial recording new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation Seen in perspective many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones Although lacking absolute verisimilitude they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck's baton or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic
Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics If we return to them today we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing
Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music This difference is made up of many factors Some of them are obvious such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat From the technical standpoint records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color texture complexity range intensity pulse and pitch of the original Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests Yet it is the accumulation of distortion the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness that makes records sound like records The sound may be good but if you know The Real Thing you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation
Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one Like the recent Scheherazade from London High Fidelity Sept. 1961 it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects Because of this only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers' triumph
The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness The effect of the recording is very open and natural with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity but it eliminates listener fatigue A contributing factor is the perspective the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes valve clicks and other noises incidental to playing Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance
All of this would be wasted of course if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score discounting tradition and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper
Those accustomed to broader more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect The Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet In the end however the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song
The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration Your ear takes you into the ensemble and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener The first substantially complete stereo Giselle and the only one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel this set is afraid likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly if suave sentimentality And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance the recording sounds as though it had been doctored for super-high fidelity The home listener is overpowered all right but the experience is a far from pleasant one As with the penultimate Giselle release Wolff's abridgment for RCA Victor I find the cleaner less razor-edged monophonic version for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness the more aurally tolerable but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies

At the Westminster KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden New York on the second day the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International
Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class
As has been the custom for the past several years John Cross Jr. Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster arranged for the Juniors' meeting before the Class and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them Over 60 Juniors parents and guests attended
Mrs. William H. Long Jr. speaks After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class Mrs. William H. Long Jr. was introduced as the first speaker
In her opening remarks Mrs. Long also welcomed the Juniors and stated There any other show quite like Westminster I know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break Mrs. Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years
Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long then 13 years of age won the Grand Challenge Trophy Children's Handling Class as they were called then at Westminster No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs. Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet or Noranda another home-bred product and won
Speaking from long years of experience Mrs. Long advised the Juniors When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement stop Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings When you and your dog step into the Junior ring it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do If you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog he will feel it and give you a good performance He knows your signals what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers
Right attitude essential
Take away your attitude said Mrs. Long and what have you left Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop Or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else maybe the way you look or the date you have after the Class or you are just doing this to please the parents
The reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce Aids sounds more like a Pony Club or horsemanship classes riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar
Your aids are your attitude which comes through your voice your hands and legs voice to encourage discourage or whatever the need may be hands to guide or restrain legs to produce motion and rate of speed Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right
Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated Have fun And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come
Harvey Barcus second speaker The second speaker was Harvey Barcus President of the Dog Writers Ass'n of America
Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors with which he is very familiar Last year a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000 He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship
Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged Is one of Mr. Barcus' strong beliefs He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division
In closing Mr. Barcus also wished all the Juniors luck in their Class
Westminster Show Notes Instead of 3 a.m. in the past the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 p.m. This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show a great advantage to them
Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up they could relax with their dogs From there on each Junior was going to be judged individually This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour 45 minutes to judge the Class
Anne Hone Rogers judges 28th finals This year Anne Hone Rogers outstanding Handler judged the Class This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class
As the Juniors entered the ring Mr. Spring the announcer stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class the Finals for the year A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible
The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen Many adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class
It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered A large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners
After the judge moved all the dogs individually she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring She then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship
International Champion of the year Betty Lou Ham age 16 Holyoke Mass. showing an Irish Setter was chosen as International Champion of the year She was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns' Leonard Brumby Sr. Memorial Trophy named for the founder-originator of the Junior Classes
Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year she also scored with an Afghan
Other winners Sydney Le Blanc age 15 Staten Island N.Y. showing a Doberman Pinscher was 2nd
Susan Hackmann age 14 from Baltimore Md. showing a Dachshund was 3rd Last year Susan also placed 3rd in the Finals at Westminster From the records we keep Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in both United States and Canada
Karen Marcmann age 16 Trapp Penna. showing a Keeshond was 4th
Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well
Entries increasing requirements raised In 1960 there were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes Each year these shows have increased in entries Next year 1962 at Westminster the Bench Show Committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more Junior Classes in the open division only to qualify for Westminster
Percy Roberts a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March
Judging class for intermediates proposed It has been suggested many times that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and enter the Junior Classes For some time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class
Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester KC Show recently Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day The Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge
We suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance Last year Robert Harris a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest Junior at the International KC of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior since the Class' inception Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them
More volunteer handlers needed to judge Superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby Sr. for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division
Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog To overcome this unfair judging the A.K.C. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class If the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world all will be helping to create future dog owners
Other awards for Juniors The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show The Kansas City and the Topeka KCs are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for Westminster The Rio Grande KC is also considering having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster
The American Pointer Club is still continuing to donate trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship Classes with Pointers
Traveling through the South over 16,000 miles with two Great Danes an Afghan and a Persian kitten worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels
My husband enters the motel office signs up for a room and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets Puppies Comes the suspicious question No he replies full grown adult show dogs housebroken and obedience-trained
never been refused
Once settled careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot keep them under control in the room and feed and bench them where they do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture
In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin
Many a motel owner when stopped there again has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children
So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination Is it that they care Are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient

At one time to most Americans unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen rich people and the United States Navy
Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport There are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960 Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea Boats are operated in every state in the Union with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident expectedly in the areas where boats have always been found the natural lakes rivers and along the nation's coastline But during the last several years boats were launched in areas where a short time ago the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock
Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government vast man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit providing boating and fishing havens all over the country
No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been for example they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake Texoma located between Texas and Oklahoma which resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River In 1959 according to the Engineers Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 persons
Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water Providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000 boat trailers now in use It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new light strong easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000 The sight of sleek inboards outboards and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace
Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year-'round anchorage for their craft will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car driving to the water and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat Today the boat on its trailer is brought to the gear and loaded at the door Arriving at the waterside the boat is launched the family taken aboard and that easily another day afloat is begun
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago This year Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national regional and local boat shows The boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons
The variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming They range from an eight-foot pram which you can build yourself for less than $50 to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000 Boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs In this respect boats can be compared with houses There is no limit to what you can spend yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget There is no question as to just what is available You name it our industry is producing it and it probably is made in different models
There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft sail power or both or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond
You may have your boat of wood canvas plywood plastic or metal You may order utility models inboard or outboard with or without toilets galleys and bunks You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose
Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash color flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat You pay your money and you take your choice
American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run
Russia whose technology is not quite primitive is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor for instance
Now here is truly a marvel The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease wherein lies their greatest advantage Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook the range being about $150 to $1,000 depending on size
Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country and to making the owning of a boat simpler There was a time when if a man wanted to purchase a boat it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel Having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later
Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles Of course individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning power credit rating and local bank policy
Outboard motors insurance and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances
When the automobile was in its embryonic stage such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where when and how fast a car could go When air travel was in its infancy the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all Man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft It was much the same with pleasure boating at first Come one come all the fine
As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do must and should do However there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating
Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways
State numbering laws differ from each other in many ways Fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft such as sailboats with no power to be registered at all Many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators
Generally states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities It is always wise to consult your marine dealer local yacht or boat club secretary or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy
Hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport the industry has been supporting an intense coordinated educational program with great success since 1947
A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers The industry has been its own watch dog With U.S. Coast Guard cooperation the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety
Industry interest in safety goes even farther In 1959 the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment A new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic City New Jersey to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe
In addition to these activities the NAEBM with headquarters at 420 Lexington Avenue New York City as well as other associations and individual manufacturers provide and distribute films booklets and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat
It is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling These are not governmentally subsidized organizations This year over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction
As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts motels and drive-in establishments where you can dine see a movie shop or make a bank deposit the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them Instead of motels for the boatman there are marinas
The word marina was coined by NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort Currently marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available gasoline fresh water electricity telephone service ice repair facilities restaurants sleeping accommodations a general store and a grocery store
Yachtel a relatively new word indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards Regardless of nomenclature yachtels and boatels are marinas
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas
A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United States the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats

The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle but once understood the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves The main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet is connected to each lever If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented
In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called dogs Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved locking and unlocking them
how the scheme works Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side thus moving one or more locking bars The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets By this scheme pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal
Interlocking signals are normally at stop or red position and a lever must be pulled to clear the signal This is not necessarily to green however for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the plant
There are other basic rules A turnout may have two levers one to actually move the switch points the other to lock the points A signal be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points face oncoming traffic The lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point If the points thrown all the way the Turnout be locked and in turn the signal be cleared Generally these locks on turnouts are called facing point locks
Figs. 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals Each diagram is accompanied by a dog chart a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars
By studying the track-signal diagrams note several other details Derails mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a stop signal are used in many instances Home signals have two blades The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect the blade does not move As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the distant signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant In some low-speed situations the distant signal is fixed at caution In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling the distant has only green and yellow aspects
So much for the prototype
The interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in Fig. 7 page 65 and in the photos how it can be built
Frame The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig. 7 most of the bars being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame which is for a junction
When cutting the pieces dress the ends smooth and square with a smooth file or sanding disk Start with the right-hand piece B Af soldering it to the lower piece A of the same material but 12'' long Let exactly 1'' of A extend beyond B and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees
Now lay 12 pieces of Af cut 5-3/4'' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' sq. This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece B Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for B Solder this second B to A at right angles There should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be 1'' from an end of the long piece
Cap this assembly with spacing bars in place with a Af bar Tack-solder all the 1/2'' sq. pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members These will be drilled and tapped later on
Now cut five Af locking bar spacers which run horizontally Position these using six intermediate temporary Af spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar A Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame Now place 12 pieces 1/2'' sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4'' long tappets as they are called Cap with a Af bar and tack-solder in place Cap the locking bar spacers with two Af directly under the first two B pieces Remove all the loose spacing bars
Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together See Fig. 7 Placement of these holes is not critical but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8'' from any edge Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the A pieces size 43 Tap the A pieces 2-56
Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars A and B pieces which are soldered together Either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions Dress all surfaces with a file cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs
Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece A as shown in Fig. 7 Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on Note 6 and 8 lock levers require holes for contacts
Now reassemble the frame using Af roundhead steel screws and nuts Put the 12 tappets and some Af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws Be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq. spacer As an anchor for the spring lock insert a Af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7 Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw Drill two No. 50 holes one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it and tap 2-56 Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth Cut five pieces of Af brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long These are supporting members for the short locking bars Locate their positions in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame Cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut Drill four No. 19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12'' long A pieces Locate the position from Fig. 7
Tappets and locking bars Draw-file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer Drill a No. 50 hole 1-1/4'' from one end and tap 2-56 See Fig. 7 Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar To find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet 1/4'' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head about 5/64'' away from the frame edge Total distance is about 21/64'' Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' tappet movement Drill a No. 50 hole tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8 Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars
To each tappet except 6 and 8 solder a Af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8 These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts
Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth snug-fitting machine when you are finished Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting
The order of fitting is not too important However we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout we will only describe the construction of one locking bar Figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions All the bars are cut from Af brass The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7 Bar C is 2-3/4'' long Draw-file the edges square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame
Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7/16'' from one end of the bar Chuck a length of 1/8'' dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8'' long Cut the piece about 9/32'' or 5/16'' long and drive it into the No. 31 hole drilled in the locking bar File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' above the bar This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 parallel to piece A See the drawings for the shape of the notch Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about
thick and 1'' dia. fitted on a 1/8'' dia. mandrel Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts File to a smooth finish A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis
Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' long on one end using Swiss pattern files This tool can also be made with a lathe

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing standardizing and communicating the things they discover and learn Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are therefore essential to any scientific endeavor
Hot rodding is a science not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is nevertheless a science But because science is based on mathematics mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems however he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed
The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula This changes the formula to an equation The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes However it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order They indicate simple division multiplication subtraction and addition
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other The lower number is always divided into the upper number Af
The symbol for multiplication is **b It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row For example Af Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order The result will be the same regardless of the order used
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign This is nothing more than a dash It separates two or more numbers The number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol For example Af When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct For example for the problem Af 10 from 25 equals 15 then 6 from 15 equals 9
Addition is indicated by the symbol The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers For example Af Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order
When solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value Multiplication subtraction and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication subtraction or addition steps Af This would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 This part of the equation would then become 4
For use in formulas fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart Charts for this purpose are available from many sources They are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result
Some formulas contain constants A constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation It is a number without which the equation be solved correctly
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and quite often are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events When it is needed one formula is as important as another However some formulas are used more than others take them in the general order of their popularity
Engine displacement A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine Displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed
Factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders the length of the piston stroke the number of cylinders in the engine and a constant The constant is which is one-quarter of 3.1416 another constant known as pi Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles
Actually the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement
The formula is Af Dimensions in inches and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters cc. One inch equals 2.54 centimeters one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters
For example consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy Aj These engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches The formula with the fractions converted to decimals becomes Af
To arrive at the answer multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right The different steps will look like this Af
Compression ratio A cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume or its displacement with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid
Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula Af
To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface Do not overfill the chamber This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber
The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters cc. making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches However the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms
The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it affect the final computation The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume
Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth The formula for this step is Af This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening The total of these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume
After the factors just described have been computed they are applied to the following formula Af
For an example dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation Af The compression ratio is 10 to 1
This method of computing compression ratio be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible with normal means to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads be readily computed The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position
Gear ratio speed relationships There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed engine speed rear axle gear ratio and rear tire size By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three
To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors These are
MPH for Car speed
for Engine crankshaft speed
for Rear axle gear ratio
for Tire size
Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made The measurement must be in inches Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula
To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula is Af For an engine speed of 5000 rpm a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 and a tire radius of 13 inches the equation would look like this Af
To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is Af Using the same figures as for the previous example the equation becomes Af
To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors the formula is Af Using the figures from the previous examples the equation becomes Af

Orlando Fla. Feb. 2 The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner Mainliner-Highland Ellen a member of the Dick Williams stable who was clocked 2:25 She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening Milwaukee Wis. who according to the railbirds can feel justly proud of her
Other good miles have been by Debonnie Dale Frost-Debby Hanover and Prompt Time Adios-On Time in 2:28-:36 Kimberly Gal Galophone-Kimberly Hanover 2:26.2 Laguerre Hanover Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover and Monel Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd in 2:34 Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation good body plenty of heart girth stands straight on his legs on excellent feet and has the smoothest gait This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races
Stardel Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover 2:34 looks quite promising Fury Hanover Hoot Mon-Fay Caper Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover and Isaac Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease They are two good colts of different type Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side and Caper is more the compact type I have never seen Caper off his feet he seems to know nothing but trot and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground
Trackdown Torrid-Mighty Lady has worked a mile in 2:33.3 It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace Then after emasculation he was eased up for a couple of weeks He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse
Thor Hanover Adios-Trustful Hanover is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual with solid rugged conformation good flat bone and excellent feet This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days and then put to cart and broken in very nicely knowing nothing but trot He appeared in the hopples about November 14 was treated for worms on the 18th the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace On December 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around out in third position all the way This colt has done everything asked of him and done it with ease His best mile to date is 2:32.2
Gamecock Tar Heel-Terka Hanover is another promising colt and his best time is 2:32.2 This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable
Hustler Knight Dream-Torkin is a playful bay rascal of a colt not the best gaited but he surely can pace and is right there with them and sometimes leading them in the best miles Torrid Freight Torrid-Breeze On Hal is a very rugged strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him His best time is around 2:33
Strongheart Adios-Direct Gal a fair-looking sorrel colt knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles Torrid Adios Torrid-Adios Molly is not so masculine as most of the colts but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me First Flyer Frisco Flyer-Castle Light looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes His best time is 2:33.2
The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything on the fillies especially the pacers Justine Hanover Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover is improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4 weeks ago
Mrs. Freight Knight Dream-Miss Reed shows promise and does it in good form and her best time is about 2:35 Hoopla Tar Heel-Holiday Hanover a filly that wanted to trot knocked herself October 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples She was then trained on the trot until December 29 hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again This time she submitted and in a few days was going good On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1--:38 on Jan. 18 2:37.3--:36.1 on Jan. 21 2:36 This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters Valentine Day and Cerise more scale and much better underpinning She is more like her full brother Taraday Hanover but larger Up to date she is a grand-looking filly
Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers Marquis Pick Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time He is a fine-looking colt with a good body good set of legs and nice way of going His best mile to date is 2:28-:33 Majestic Pick comes next with a mile in 2:30-:33.2 This colt is another fine-looking equine Staley Hanover Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class Best time to date is 2:34-:34 Step Aside Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise
Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked from 2:40 to 2:35 Bonnie Wick Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary has gone in 2:36 Hickory Ash Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover in 2:35 The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself that must be Hickory Ash She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot Hickory Hill Star's Pride-Venus Hanover has gone in 2:33 Hickory Spark Harlan-Hickory Tiny 2:37 Buxton Hanover Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover 2:35 Faber's Kathy Faber Hanover-Ceyway 2:37 Honor Rodney Rodney-Honor Bright around 2:40 The last-named is a fine-looking large colt who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries He is going sound again now and looks good

The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun we ran a survey to find out but always on the lookout for new and better arms more than a reader of outdoor articles a real hunter and shooter eager to improve his sport Well if that kind of sportsman here to help you probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack but not easy to decide on a new one You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts appreciate most the time to decide on them is now As a Christmas service taken a close look at this year's crop of new models Here they are with my comments and judgments Read on take your pick and start dropping those hints
First on my own list would be two arms a rifle and a handgun that qualify as new in the strictest sense For me a changed barrel length or an improved stock constitute a truly new design Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts
Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker under $110 is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans a short light quick-handling fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game whitetail
Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot and the Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency these are fairly large tough animals
The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me At least five years ago Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20-gauge size After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then unaccountably one could stray far out of the group
Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet The new jacketed slug in Magnum corrected this But even without jacketed bullets I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards He moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling
Three more deer have fallen to this same gun and all were one-shot kills My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels before cutting to revolver length and although it compares well in other respects considerably heavier than the Deerstalker which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds
If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter this is it The Deerstalker points with the ease speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun and its trigger pull is light and sharp The 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 fps which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges With five shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger finger the gun and load are a deadly combination
The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load the
Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire At present available in one model the fine and familiar Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver about $110 long a top-quality handgun among target arms The velocity of this
40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 fps and the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range This is a varmint load pure and simple much too explosive for small edible game It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers
The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard
rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm although the difference in the point of impact Jet vs. rim-fire can be somewhat disconcerting The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily
Hunting rifles '61 The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year mean that 1961 see changes in models actions and calibers Aside from the Ruger carbine a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time Here are the brands in alphabetical order and the new models
Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action high-power rifles They have fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available and these include the standard bores about $165 plus the Magnums around $170 the latter include the
S & H and Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the
Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes
Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions regardless of caliber The
have the short action the
and the medium action and the
Af and the Magnums the long action about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version Previously FN actions were used for the larger cartridges
High Standard has introduced a
auto the Sport-King in two grades field and special less than $45 and just over $45 respectively a streamlined rifle fast and well-made
Among
Magnum Rim-Fire rifles 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader around $60 Previously known as Jefferson Arms Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle
Magnum rim-fires
Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings The Model 99 under $45 is a light-weight streamlined
rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles extremely accurate for an auto and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning The 989 about $40 is an even newer
auto this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip
Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which surprisingly gives pretty fair accuracy even though only 3-1/2 inches long You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with
shotshells to break the little Targo clay targets A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available You can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater the 340TR about $40 or a single-shot the 320TR $10 less
The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice but tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds right now
Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961 with the addition of the and to the list of Model 725's These are made on special order only in Kodiak grade about $310 with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads they weigh around nine pounds
A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 This carbine under $140 about $15 more for a deluxe grade has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard Presently the 742C is available in Af
The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight about $125 and the 99 Deluxe under $135 which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate
Beginners' guns '61 A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 and good bets for your Christmas gift list if wondering what to get for a youngster The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 about $20 $5 for a saddle scabbard a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look Because of its traditional lines it probably has more kid appeal than any other model The action is a drop-block handling all the standard
rim-fires
Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter although a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock This is the Model 122 about $20 a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety i.e. the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot Stock design is excellent and this model is a good first gun Another boy's model is the
single-shot Remington 514C around $20 which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short 12-1/2-inch stock just right for a boy of 12-1/2
A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year The single-barrel Stevens 940Y under $35 is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun and the side lever does indeed open very easily This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge another addition to the Stevens line the pump-action Model 77 in under $75 which you may or may not consider a kid's gun many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too
Shotguns '61 Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market For example a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under the Broadway from $350 up depending on grade differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting
The Colt line now includes a new scattergun the Standard or Custom Pump Model about $90 and $150 respectively in 12 16 and 20
Firearms International has introduced another import this one from Finland the Valmet about $170 a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32 which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices
High Standard has also added two models to its line The Supermatic Trophy prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features is a 12-gauge auto The Flite-King Trophy beginning at just over $85 is a pump gun in 12 or 16 Either model is a very good dollar value

Handguns '61 Aside from the
Jet which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns

Livery stable J. Vernon prop. Coaching had declined considerably by 1905 but the sign was still there near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for he had prospered but he could not retire from horsedom Coaching was in his blood He had two interests in life the pleasures of the table and driving Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road upland and through the redwood forest with orchards below him at one hand and glimpses of the Pacific at the other The journey back he made along the coast road traveling hell-for-leather every lantern of the tallyho ablaze
The southward route was the classic run in California and the most fashionable His patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans regulars most of them and trenchermen like himself They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting seven in the morning nor of the tariff which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa Cruz
Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring so halts were contrived between meals Then the Chinese hostler who rode with Vernon on the box would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon sandwiches pickled eggs and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp
In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine They gathered roots bulbs odd ferns leaves and bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains In the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks and he was glad when the trips dropped off and the botanists began to motor out by themselves
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run This was an honor like dining with a captain at his private table Vernon's office adjoined the stable and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs the folk art of the period They advertised harness polish liniments Ball's Rubber Boots Green River Whiskey Hood's Sarsaparilla patent medicines shoe blacking and chewing tobacco
The hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove then a porter from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters Vernon was consummately fond of oysters and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil War Oyster salt roast oysters on the half shell cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served was a standby at Manning's Its early morning patrons were coachmen who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy
In the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager John C. Kirkpatrick This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans though the Palace chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters Gastronomes have long argued about which came first the Palace's or Antoine's Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding The Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional Vernon however held out for plain oyster roast and plenty of it unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt though he did fancy a bit of lemon
After the meal he and his guests went out to inspect the rig this was merely a ritual to please all hands concerned The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300 A replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club in the East and matchless west of the Rockies it was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run One could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels The horses were groomed to a high gloss departing they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw for they had been trained to drag at important funerals
But for the start of the Santa Cruz run the whip fell The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven They had been fed a hunting breakfast so called because a kedgeree the dish identified with fox hunting was on the bill There are many ways of making a kedgeree every one of which is right Here is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's kitchen
Club Kedgeree Flake for three a cupful of cold boiled haddock mix with a cupful of cooked rice two minced hard-boiled eggs some buttery white sauce done with cream cayenne pepper salt a pinch of curry a tablespoonful of minced onion fried and a bit of anchovy Heat and serve hot on toast
The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast the Palace's chef was even more in demand For decades it was the most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still survive Native California oysters salty and piquant as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece went into it The original formula goes thus
omelet Arbogast Fry in butter a small minced onion rub with a tablespoonful of flour add half a cup of cream six beaten eggs pepper celery salt a teaspoonful of minced chives a dash of cayenne and a pinch of nutmeg A jigger of dry Sherry follows and as the mixture stiffens in go a hundred of the little oysters
Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York J. Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco to attend an Episcopal convention and brought the restaurateur with him As things happened Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent Sherry remained in his hotel suite where he amused himself as best he could Twice he left everything to his entourage and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance
In the grand court of the Palace notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below Vernon's station was at the entrance It was a post of honor held inviolate for him he had the primacy among the coachmen Of majestic build rubicund and slash-mouthed he resembled the late General Winfield Scott who was said to be the most imposing general of his century if not of all centuries Vernon wore a gray tall hat a gardenia and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly
Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho He had style he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout and when the horses leaned at a curve as if bent by the force of a gale he leaned with them They cantered down the peninsula not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin
The road maps of the region have changed since 1905 inns have burned down moved elsewhere or taken other names Once on the road and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine the schedule meant nothing An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho from which there issued clouds of smoke Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard indulging in a huge cigar The horses moved at a clump they were no more on parade than was their driver one fork of the road was as good as another The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain even when heat bakes the Santa Clara valley below at the left The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery You arrive there in seersucker and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh
Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage A number of them must have fallen into disfavor they were struck out with remarks in red ink denouncing both the cooks and the management He was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat The horses seemed to know these by instinct he used to say such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins
There was Wright's for one lost amongst trees its wide verandas strewn with rockers Many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet and lived there to the end of their days It was the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce who admired its redwoods Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs akin to Berkshires whose carcass sweepstakes were renowned Their ham butts cured in oak-log smoke were also esteemed when roasted or boiled and served with this original sauce
Wright's devil sauce put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy or of the boiled ham liquor with a half stick of butter three teaspoonfuls of made mustard and two mashed garlic cloves Contribute also an onion a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins and a mashed lime After this has simmered an hour add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire catsup and chutney two pickled walnuts and a pint of Sherry Then simmer fifteen minutes longer
Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar so that when its turn came it was properly mellowed
Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's and deer were rather a nuisance they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers But no one complained when they wound up regardless of season in venison pies No one complained of the white wine either at this altitude of two thousand feet grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height Apple trees grew there also Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle
Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets The merit of the pie Vernon believed was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven The recipe which he got from the baker and wrote down in his ledger is basically this
Wright's apple pie peel core and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin and set aside In a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them an equal amount of sugar a sliced lemon a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam a pinch each of clove and nutmeg and a large bay leaf Let this boil gently for twenty minutes then strain Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes drain them and cool
Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter with as much brown sugar a sprinkling of nutmeg and a fresh bay leaf then lay on a cover of pastry and gild it with beaten yolk of egg

Built upon seven hills Istanbul like Rome is one of the most ancient cities in the world filled with splendor and contrast It is an exotic place so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses At the moment many of these are being pulled down Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn Even when they are finished however the contrast will remain for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets
Founded in the Ninth Century B.C. it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas ruler of the Megarians expanded the settlement and named it after himself About a thousand years after that when the Roman Empire was divided it became capital of the Eastern section On May 11,330 A.D. its name was changed again this time to Constantinople after its emperor Constantine In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks the city officially shifted religions although the Patriarch or Pope of the Orthodox Church continued to live there and still does and became the capital of the Ottoman Empire When that was broken up after the First World War its name was changed once more Rich in Christian and Moslem art Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the center of town Easy to get to and becoming more popular every year it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World Airways jet four hours from Rome
Start of tour Most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel From there I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left Republic Gardens and came in a few moments to Taksim Square one of the hubs of the city with the Monument of the Republic erected in 1928 in its center
Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop sign for T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus past ocean liners at anchor to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus Across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque
On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square with Yeni Cami or the New Mosque which dates from the Seventeenth Century just across from the entrance to the bridge Passing it the bus climbed a hill with the covered spice bazaar on the right and Pandelli's a famous and excellent restaurant above it At the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park I got off there crossed the street walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left the Blue Mosque on my right and in a moment came to the entrance of St. Sophia
Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St. Sophias the first of which was begun by Constantine this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem A few years later the dome fell in Nevertheless it remained one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque adding the stubby minarets In the second half of the Sixteenth Century Sinan the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome With the birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World War St. Sophia became a museum and the ancient mosaics which were plastered over by the Moslems whose religion forbids pictures in holy places have been restored
Inside over the first door I saw one of these which shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing The eight green columns I learned came from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus the others red from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis
Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork where the emperors and after them the sultans sat Directly opposite is the emperor's door through which they entered the building
Outside St. Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome now a park It was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen mostly by the waves of Crusaders
At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome built in 1895 by the German Emperor and on my left directly across from it the tomb of Sultan Ahmet who constructed the Blue Mosque more properly known by his name
Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street entered the Hippodrome and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C. by Thutmose who also built those now in New York London and Rome at the Lateran This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them
Beyond it I noted a small green column about twelve feet below the present ground level the Serpentine Column three entwined serpents which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi Greece Near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column a truncated obelisk of blocks all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes
Magnificent Mosque Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet only one with six minarets I entered the courtyard with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle One of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century with a huge central dome two half domes that seem to cascade down from it and smaller full domes around the gallery The round minarets tall and graceful rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer Inside the walls are covered with blue and white tile the floor with red and cream carpets
Back at the Kaiser's Fountain I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill any car will do past the Column of Constantine also known as the Burnt Column at the top on my right It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine who brought it from Rome
I stayed on the car for a few minutes until turning right it entered a huge square Bayezit with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it There I got off crossed the square and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant hard to come by in this part of the city Called the Marmara Gazinosu it is on the third floor with signs pointing the way there and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara After lunch in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava a sweet flaky cake in Istanbul a great favorite of the university students and I joined them there for dessert
Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain I walked ahead then left down the street opposite St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small one-story building with a red-tile roof which is the entrance to the Sunken Palace Actually an underground cistern its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply the palace with water There is still water in it I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately
Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia turned left at the end of it and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet
Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall I entered the grounds of Topkapi Palace home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance past the Church of St. Irene completed by Constantine in 330 A.D. on my left and then just outside the second gate I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right the Executioner's Spring where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims
Passing through the gate with towers on either side once used as prisons I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds with explanations in English for each building There are a good many of them At one time about 10,000 people lived there
Following arrowed signs I veered right toward the former kitchens complete with chimneys which now house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services Next to it is a copper section with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate floor-length robe
In the court once more I went right toward the Reception House a long one-story building with a deep portico Going through a door into another small court I had the Throne Room directly in front I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the Treasury which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds jewelled swords rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds on which the sultans sat cross-legged They are made of gold and covered with emeralds pearls and other jewels
Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it the Portrait Gallery I went right at the end of it through a garden to a small building at the back a sitting room furnished with low blue divans its floor covered with carpets its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs

Do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot and to stop flames that arise from melting grease
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat
forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent rinse thoroughly
Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables sauces and such
fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results
Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them If doubtful about a steak boldly cut it in half If necessary to replace both halves on grill sear cuts and allot extra time For roasts insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals
practice a new recipe on guests Have a test-run on the family first to be sure timing and seasoning are right
Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it Keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking and keep it in the coldest but non-freezing compartment of the refrigerator
plan meals that are too complicated Limit yourself to good meat and drink with bread salad corn or potatoes as accessories Keep the desserts simple fruit does nicely
Do whatever kitchen work such as fixing a salad preparing garlic bread or making a marinade sauce ahead of time When you start the outdoor performance you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen This goes for getting a drink tray ready and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins
think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world The simplest grill pan type or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef You need tongs to handle meat long forks for turning potatoes and corn heavy foil on hand at all times And lots of hot pads
Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up flames reach the meat
forget to have a supply of Melamine plates bowls cups saucers and platters for outdoor use Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors There is even one set that has barbecue written on it
Do without fancy tablecloths cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues Oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best Tougher than plastic it wears well
forget when you take to the hills or the beach that your cooler which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes With them you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders to the marina or picnic in A-1 condition
Do use paper napkins lots of them Except when you prepare do it yourself shish kebob or a lobster roast Then want terry cloth towels for mopping up
think barbecue cooking is just sometimes or seasonal year-round and everywhere In the winter hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter inside Summertime supper outside is a natural find once your technique is perfected that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic
Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot Be sure to get a few more than you need You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one use six for drinks serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen and need one more to mix the salad dressing
forget the joys of a meal on the road If you travel over the vast U.S.A. you will no doubt discover that feeding is an expensive business Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work You can take it with you A picnic bag a grill a cooler for soft drinks and beer and for frozen convenience foods Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings or just evenings Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities and with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up hamburger buns an array of relishes and fresh fruit your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant and 100% more fun You need a little stove a coffee pot and a stew pot maybe a skillet a basket of essentials like salt pepper plates forks knives and a can opener As you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal For 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car
Simple meat dishes spice is a fact of life in the U.S.A. You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics cervelat salami Vienna sausages mettwurst bratwurst bockwurst knackwurst Bologna pepperoni blutwurst and you have a long list of easy specialties Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes a bit of green pepper a fresh white mushroom any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook and a meal a feast
Sure for the most of us a frankfurter is the favorite A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St. Louis around 1883 served his sausages grilled and mustard to his fancy customers So that his customers should not soil their hands Feuchtwanger issued white gloves Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks Years later franks-in-buns were accepted as the first to go at the New York Polo Grounds
The nation's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter toasted over a bonfire on the beach or more sedately charcoal broiled on a portable grill Either way hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation To make the picnic frank come close to perfection remember these tips
Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking
Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns Bring along the conventional ones catsup pickle relish mustard mayonnaise plus a few extras such as tangy barbecue sauce chive cream cheese or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd
Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns too Watch closely while browning them as it take long
An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic Broil or toast as usual
Contrary to popular opinion a la mode mean with ice cream it just means in the latest style Here are a couple of the latest highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering Jiffy barbecues 1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped spiced ham 6 sandwich buns heated
Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan heat thoroughly Add ham heat Serve on buns Makes 6 barbecues Hot hibachi franks never hear sayonara the Japanese word for goodbye from your guests when you give a hibachi party The fun of toasting their own sausages over the small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces will keep your group busy try it and see Canned cocktail frankfurters sweet-sour sauce 1 large onion chopped fine 2 tablespoons salad oil 1 8-oz. can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce pineapple chunks Mustard cream 2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1/2 cup heavy cream whipped Salt Paprika
Spear canned cocktail franks with picks Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl
Make sauces ahead Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage Mustard cream used as alternate dip for franks and pineapple tidbits tastes best when served at room temperature
For sweet-sour sauce cook onion in oil until soft Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil Simmer about 10 minutes and keep warm for serving
To prepare mustard cream blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste Fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika Trim-your-own-franks A back-yard picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer Be sure to have plenty of frankfurters and buns on hand Some tasty frank toppings are chili con carne Coney Island sauce and savory sauerkraut Serve the chili and kraut hot with the franks

Note Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery Instructions for preparing clay drying glazing and firing are not given
Equipment Basic pottery studio equipment Wooden butter molds and cookie presses
Materials Ceramic modeling clay red white or buff Stoneware clay for tiles Glazes one-stroke ceramic colors stains cones as indicated in the individual instructions
General directions Use well-wedged clay free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly they must be free of oil wax and dust Pressing designs The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions Whenever possible use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay When mold has more than one design cavity make individual paper patterns Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold To obtain clear impression of mold press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity starting at center and working to outer edges Trim excess clay away from outer edges Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles Allow project to stand for about five minutes if wooden press mold is a good antique do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack
To release clay from mold place hands in a cupped position around project gently lift the edge on far side then continue to release edge completely around mold Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat clay and mold in one action This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending causing warping when fired Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections If clay is slightly out of shape square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides or smooth round pieces with damp fingers If the background of design is too smooth or you wish to create a wood-grained effect it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush Make slight smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping
Rectangular tiles opposite page right top Stoneware clay was used Clay was rolled to 1/4'' thickness Back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping surface No bisque firing Glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white stoneware glaze no glaze on sides or bottom Decorated on unfired glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors raised details of designs were colored in shades of yellow-green blue-green brown and pink Tiles were fired once to cone 05

Jars with lids opposite page top left Remove wooden design head from bowl of butter mold Fill small hole in bowl with clay Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid see Fig. 1 opposite page Measurements for rectangular pattern piece A are obtained by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl Pattern for circular base piece B is diameter of Aj Use wooden design head of mold for pattern C pattern D for lid fits over top diameter of Aj Pattern for inner lid piece E fits inside Aj Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold
Use white or buff clay rolled to 3/16'' thickness Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position Place clay pieces on wall board
To assemble jar put paper pattern B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk B on top Line sides of mold with paper pattern Aj Bevel and score ends of clay piece A so that they overlap about 1/2'' and make even thickness Place clay piece A inside use slip to join overlapped ends together Join B to bottom of A scoring and reinforcing with clay coil Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside while assembling lid
To assemble lid press clay piece C in cavity of wooden design head Press clay into mold as instructed in General Directions Score plain side of C and leave in mold Score one side of disk D join to C score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before While assembled lid is still on design head gently but firmly press it on plaster board If design head has a deep cavity clay lid will be quite thick at this point press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing Check fit of lid on jar if inner lid is too big trim to fit allowing room for thickness of glaze Remove lid from head of mold Remove jar from mold Place jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly Bisque fire to cone 08 with lid on jar
For an antique effect on jars brush Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off Glaze with two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze The large jar was brushed with Creek-Turn green toner and sponged off Glaze with two coats of matt glazes in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid When dry they were fired to cone 06-05
Little folks set Made from modern wooden molds Af Roll white clay to 3/16'' thickness Salt and pepper Use mold to cut four side pieces For top and bottom pieces use short end of mold as measurement guide Press the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold Trim excess clay from rim of mold Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45-degree angle to miter corners Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold place design-side up on plaster board Make all four sides Cut clay top and base pieces place on plaster board Allow all pieces to become leather hard before constructing shaker To assemble Construct sides bottom and top as for box using slip on scored edges and coils of clay to reinforce seams Join the four sides together first then add the base add top last Use water on finger to smooth seams and edges Turn shaker upside down Recess base slightly to allow room for stopper Cut hole in base for cork stopper Add holes in top forming S for salt and P for pepper Set aside to dry thoroughly Sugar and creamer Cut a strip of clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold design Press clay into cavity of one mold three times bevel overlapping ends for splice joint score beveled edges Form clay strip into a cylinder use slip to join scored ends Place cylinder on a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder Score bottom edge of cylinder and join to disk with slip Trim away excess clay reinforce seam with a coil of clay This will form the sugar bowl Make creamer the same
Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' wide and 3-1/2'' long To add handle place a wooden dowel against the inside wall of creamer Score outside of container where handle ends will be joined Bend handle press scored handle ends firmly in place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing use slip to join To form spout between two designs dampen area slightly and gently push clay outward Make lid for sugar bowl the same as jar lids omitting design disk Cut a notch in lid for spoon handle if desired Set aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl Vases Make same as salt and pepper shakers leaving off top pieces Vases may be made into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick Napkin holder Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each about Af long enough for three impressions of mold Press the two sides into cavity of one mold three times Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard state Score side edges of base join sides and base with slip and reinforce with coil A cardboard pattern cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping Place pattern inside holder use three strips of clay to hold in place see Fig. 2 page 71 Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would cause breakage
Let all projects dry slowly for several days Clean greenware Bisque fire to cone 08 Inside of pieces was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged off to give antique finish Fired to cone 06-05

Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom bunks for three galley and marine toilet The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit All are well distributed not crowded together near the stern And with passenger weight shifted forward Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800 The 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard
With only two aboard Hotei does better than 27 mph and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser Nor is she a wet boat been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry
A lot of thought went into storage space construction a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis life jackets etc. The aft cockpit has a Af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat On each side of the motor well storage for battery bumpers line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it
Needless to say you build Hotei in a couple of weeks Our building time was slightly over 400 hours but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom sink head and hardware was under $800 A comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000 Consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it A Gator trailer Model 565 is used to transport the boat to the waterways This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years
All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which in the dressed state you buy it is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings Therefore the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens etc. on a table saw Besides flathead bronze screws silicon bronze Stronghold nails made by Independent Nail & Packing Co. Bridgewater Mass. are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints
Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor Draw each outline in a different-color chalk one on top of the other In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes
The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped glued and fastened with one-inch No. 12 Stronghold nails After notching it for the keelson chines and battens the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint again using the one-inch No. 12 nails The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines If notched for the battens they would require more work be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking
The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction Be sure all members are parallel vertical and level as required
After the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson The frames are glued and screwed to this piece The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced
The keelson made of two three-inch widths is next installed The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first Note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end One-inch No. 10 screws are used in both cases
A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one The stem is laminated from four pieces Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson A number of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets
All bottom battens are two inches wide The side ones are a half-inch narrower The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames Glue and 1-1/2-inch No. 10 screws are used Placement is important because the rear seat bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens With the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending
Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips The aluminum flush against the battens acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily If you own a planer and want to buy one well worth renting
The planking is five-ply 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood This can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long The 42-inch width leaves very little waste Four pieces are used Plank the sides first using glue and one-inch No. 12 Stronghold nails at all battens the stem and the transom Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off Then trim the excess I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter Cable for this job good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw
When cut the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming Then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames keelson and all the battens It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points Then it is replaced and fastened The bottom planking is applied in the same manner
After planking the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails they are also rough-sanded in that area The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin When the resin has hardened mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish I used bright red mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener Using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth When the cloth is smooth apply another coat of resin spreading it with a paint roller Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden
When the whole bottom has hardened use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail Then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem Before the resin has hardened screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline This protects the bottom in beaching Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co. 1605 W. Elizabeth Ave. Linden N. J. They will also supply literature on application
The hull is now turned over with the help of about seven friends and placed in a level well-braced position I set it on the Gator trailer I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also installing a bow eye at this time For added strength I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint Again these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed
After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height the top of the side planking is installed This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry When on the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten
The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces
The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring The exception is where the flooring butts These battens are glued and screwed to the frames
With all deck battens in place the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place
After the decking is on the cabin sides are installed followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin
Inside bunks are framed up and installed as indicated A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink For padding the seats and bunks I used Ensolite Type Aj Lightweight non-absorbent fire resistant and dimensionally stable it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement Available in Af sheets it costs about a dollar a square foot

You can build this vacation cottage yourself It is a full scale small but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials and requires the use of only simple tools On the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim
In recognition of the growing trend for second homes or vacation cottages we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind It is a big project not to be taken lightly But each step has been broken down into easy stages utilizing standard materials and simple tools well within the capabilities of the handyman
The theory The idea behind our design is modular units or panelization Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors making for a minimum of cutting We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop panel by panel according to plan Thus when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend The roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure
A warning Due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country the first thing to do is to find out what if any they are Close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all This can usually be found out at the nearest town hall At the same time check the electrical plumbing and sanitary requirements as well as possible zoning regulations Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not check the local customs in the use of bottled or L-P gas we give you alternatives later on Be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion If there are any major restrictions they usually can be obtained in printed form Where a building permit is required find out what you must present when applying for one In many cases you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector These will be available at cost from our Plans Department
The site Some general things to look for in a site if you already bought one are accessibility water drainage and orientation How are the roads and how will they stand up Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property swampy areas or intermittent springs A visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative Note where the sun rises and sets and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from Will the view be something you can live with worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain we will take up alternative foundations later on
The materials With this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic AjA version and the expandable AjB version This will be for the shell of the house only roof walls and floor and does not include the carport or balcony This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost Bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions fancy flooring appliances and fixtures electrical wiring and plumbing all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues
The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade free from structural faults They should be as straight as possible as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood plastic coated panel board high density particle board asbestos-cement board or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired All panel board comes in standard Af foot size It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail with a drop door for ventilation There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown leaving no wastage The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected All nails should be rustproof and aluminum is highly recommended Note If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other and 1/8-inch glass is used stock lumber in Af Af and Af can be used in making the glass panels Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim In any case there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels
With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools fixtures and attachments available the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool The drill press consists of a vertical shaft spindle which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck a tubular housing quill in which the spindle is mounted a head in which the quill is mounted a feed lever which moves the quill up or down a power source and a movable table upon which the work is placed There is often a means of locking the quill and on larger presses the table can be tilted
The size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold or distance between the spindle center and the column A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle
A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work
Set-up and maintenance The drill press should be leveled and depending on whether it is a bench or floor model bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy
A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush
Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys slip when pulled by hand excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released loosening the lock nut or screw and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension counter-clockwise will increase it
lose the chuck key Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key otherwise have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use
Feeds and speeds Drill speeds are important if you want a good job Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed depending on the material worked On most drill presses it is impossible to get the exact speed but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys You will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds Generally the larger the tool and the harder the material the slower the speed
Feed pressure is also of major importance Too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools Too light a feed particularly with metal or other hard material causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate
Common drilling tools There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes The most common are the twist drill the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades the double spur bit and the power wood bit All will do a good job if sharp but the twist drills cut quite as smoothly as the others since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts
The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced they should be used at the slowest speed available and fed very slowly to avoid binding Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool so if you want to avoid nicked fingers keep your hands well out of the way
Simple hole drilling operations When drilling all the way through a workpiece always place a piece of scrap wood underneath This will not only protect the work table but also assure a clean breakthrough Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through then drill half way with the dimensional bit turn the piece over and finish from the other side In soft woods with pronounced grain there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander due to the varying hardness of the wood In this case drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy
When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth mark the depth on the side of the stock then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark The depth gauge rod can now be set and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth

The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects For their length their types of construction their picturesque settings and their literary associations they should be known and remembered In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection
The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part and perhaps the most interesting one connected Newbury now Newburyport with Salisbury Point Its building was first proposed in 1791 when a group of citizens mostly Newburyport men petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation This document began No. 1 Newbury Port may 30th 1791
Whereas a Bridge over Merrimack River from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf Esquire in Newbery to Deer Island and from said Island to Salisbury would be of very extensive utility by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year and at all Times of Tide
We the Subscribers do agree that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this or a similar Writing We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge and on like Terms and if such an Act shall be obtained then we severally agree each with the others that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names the whole into two hundred shares being divided and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners as by the said proposed Corporation shall be directed and required
This paper was signed by forty-five persons subscribing a total of two hundred shares
A month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built The matter was considered and reconsidered and finally opposed but in spite of many objections the Court granted a charter on January 9 1792 On November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened
Timothy Palmer who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex or Deer Island bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of William Coombs who received $300 as recompense
This two-part bridge is best described by Rev. Timothy Dwight president of Yale College in his Travels In New-England And New-York published in New Haven in 1821 He says of it
It consists of two divisions separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore The division between the island and this shore consists principally of an arch whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet and whose vortex is forty feet it was actually 37 feet above the high-water mark In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only and had never seen a structure of this nature he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention
It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect Moody Spofford It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth Haverhill and Philadelphia
The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered As far as we know no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792 Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the Massachusetts Magazine in May 1793 which is reproduced herewith Fig. 1 A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber Between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet between the north shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long
A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place July 4 1793 in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter who was one of the first share-holders stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion The Essex Journal says that he delivered an oration on the bridge which for elegance of style propriety of speech or force of argument was truly Ciceronian The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek because Dexter's oration could hardly be understood and although he later explained that he was talking French it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening
The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning It stood in its original form until 1882 The southern half however on account of its underbracing was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County Pennsylvania Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work
An advertisement in the Newburyport Herald December 21 1810 shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges It reads chain bridges
Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge in the states of Massachusetts New Hampshire Vermont Rhode Island and Connecticut so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges
Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site and lay out and superintend the work or recommend a suitable person to execute it
John Templeman
Approved Timothy Palmer
This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end It fell February 6 1827 carrying with it a horse and wagon two men and four oxen The horse and men were saved but the oxen drowned In spite of this catastrophe the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17 1827 This second chain bridge was 570 feet long had two thirty-foot towers and a draw and a double roadway
The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways
Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use the old covered wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site May 28th to June 3rd Colonel Frederick W. Lander impersonated will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's now College Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's West Virginia Infantry then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops thus the old bridge has another distinction that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s
The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements war fire and floods as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic for more than a hundred years Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.S. Route 250 the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike It is one of the very few if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S. highway system thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days
This covered wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3 1861 and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story So frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West Virginia
Completed and opened for traffic in 1852 the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his brother Eli of Beverly The Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders and against the competition of other and better known bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years before as well as many other bridges for several counties The Philippi bridge however was the Chenoweth master piece with its 139-foot dual lane span and it stands today as a monument to its builders Never rebuilt the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers a concrete floor and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic
During the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams
But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier General William E. Grumble Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May 1863 General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings including the long bridge at Fairmont and after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it Reverend Joshual Corder a Baptist minister gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure he reasoned and argued pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat Jones relented he did not order his men to apply the torch the drove of livestock was driven up the valley via Beverly and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden
Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it after filling its two lanes with hay and straw but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose
Centering around this historic old structure a group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi

It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool eight enlightening vigorous rigorous not wholly unrewarding years We have learned a lot a dash of hydrochemistry here a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds True our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools thereby diluting our spectacular attractions But problems cling to pools as any pool owner knows So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience
Where to put it Position may not be everything but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties social and/or physical We speak from varying viewpoints One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house The other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill
If you are dreaming of a blue shimmering pool right outside your living room windows close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children damp towels squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys You are likely to be nearer the truth
You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters the greater the chance for violation of family privacy annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude On the other hand out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool
Another dilemma As picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed
As in choosing a wife it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good In the colder climes for instance you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay or an ice floe studded with logs Even a neat plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold We do however recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk flora and fauna generally from accidentally wintering in the pool
Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land But if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods but good hard pavement
The placement of your pool however will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety Coping with them demands stern discipline of yourself as well as of your family neighbors friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet
Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled Had we taken a lien on a state park Not at all We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks We were in business
From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step no more than the change from city clothes to trunks Naive of us maybe but the results of our impulsive invitations to come over next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and unsettling
Our book of etiquette After the first few weeks it was obvious that rules had to be made laid down and obeyed even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result So rules we made in unabashed collusion Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners
First and foremost No one no not anyone in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool but on our terms and at our times
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand
No ringers either even if they are trailing legitimate invitees We want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring so that we end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August
No young children may come without adults except for a specific organized chaperoned party And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities A gaggle of gabbling mothers backs to the pool is no safeguard
No bottle pool is tolerated bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run Sanity solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop
We designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young less fortunate than ours
We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides
All dressing undressing to be more exact must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers' homes To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool and the parking area We do however provide a limited number of extra suits mainly for children and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences Life-preservers the buckle-on kapok-filled kind are held in readiness too for the very young
Preserving life and limb Safety rules of course are more important than all the others put together
In many localities now the law requires all pools to be fenced usually to a minimum height of 5 feet But fenced or unfenced no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay We allow no underwater endurance contests either or inexpert versions of water polo
Diving boards must have non-skid surfaces coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly but grit-impregnated paints are excellent And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge
Our pools also have wide shallow steps for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords
All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups
When you first acquire a pool we earnestly recommend for your own mental health a good long chat with your insurance agent You should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits
Soignee pools alas do not just happen They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements Unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity its care and feeding from pH content to filtering and vacuuming is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service Of course if your pool is close to the house your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores you hope Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers Even so every pool owner in case of emergency should have some idea of what makes things work A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis
Preserving the pool A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight You need more chlorine The walls feel slippery You need algaecide With or without professional help you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse
You should see to it that the trap the dirt-catcher in front of the filter is always clean A pool is no place for a shut trap
You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water When shed they leave rust marks
You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing It has happened
Many hours of spring cleaning will be saved however if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall As the pool is emptied stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp but requires dynamite if allowed to dry If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out Of course when your 6-inch torrent of water is released it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties Do not forget this possibility
If your pool is located on or near sloping ground it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris
It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around Once on the water these little visitors seldom leave and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense
Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible from pipes to brushes Follow pool-care instructions to the letter and be sure that one person in the family or not is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job with no chance for claiming It my turn
Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves even if the little boys do want to play space ship You may find yourself hitting bottom literally as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in

Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years Fortunately it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress Even if you live above that line the FHA will back you for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged
New simplified packaged units recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 Two men can often do the installation in a day You can install it yourself this is a central system that will cool every part of your house Its upkeep No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs Is it worth-while
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable and accurate controls assure the comfort we want
We know too that health is never harmed by summer cooling On the contrary there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills The filtered air benefits allergies asthma sinus hay fever Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat
Housekeeping is easier The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum fewer trips to the dry cleaners lighter loads for the washing machine The need for reupholstering redecorating repainting becomes more infrequent Clothes hold their shape better and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words
It will improve your disposition When less fatigued things just naturally look brighter The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms sleep longer and better too awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves
You can forget about screens and leave the storm windows up all year around
Best of all central air conditioning is something you can afford Like its long-lived cousin the refrigerator a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more That brings its per-year cost down mighty low For any house
No matter what style your home is ranch two-story Colonial or contemporary central air conditioning is easily installed The equipment take up valuable space either It can go in out-of-the-way waste space
But no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build If done the house can be designed and oriented for best operation and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself
If you see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building by all means make provision for its easy adding later Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial
If your house is to have a forced warm air system cooling can be a part of it This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system for your regular heating ductwork filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone high or low boy horizontal or counterflow The units can be installed in basement attic crawlspace or in a closet located in the living area The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard garage carport or basement
If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system there are things to watch for Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed They may be inaccessible later Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone Be sure you get a perimeter heating system and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house For cooling chilled water is circulated instead of hot water Instead of radiators have cooling-heating units each with its own thermostat These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems The minimum cost for an average one-story 7-room house with basement is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone Separate systems
If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system The simplest kind of separate system uses a single self-contained unit It is in effect an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled cleaned dehumidified air where it is wanted
In a long rambling ranch two such units can be installed one serving the living area the other the sleeping zone In a two-story house one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor another in the attic to cool the second In each case having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control The heat pump
One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating As you know a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors
Up until recently this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees Now the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone
Consider it as a standby setup at negligible cost for those emergencies when the furnace quits a blizzard holds up fuel delivery or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you want to start up your whole heating plant What size conditioner
How large a cooling unit you need and the method of its installation depends on a variety of factors Among other things besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family Families with children usually want the house quite so cool If you are a party thrower you may need added capacity The body is a heat machine and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load
Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of Aj A BTU is a unit of heat and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour A very rough rule of thumb is that under favorable conditions need 15 BTU's of cooling for every square foot of your house This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees need more if the high average is above that less if below
Coolers are also rated by tons A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice By accepted definition a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 BTU of cooling in one hour
You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower It is generally an inaccurate method of rating for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor and many other components beside it determine how much cooling get A 1-hp conditioner for example may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 Aj
The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need rather than trying to do this yourself
urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big why
Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly then shut down for a long period Before it cycles on again humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low With a unit of the right size a compressor will run continuously during hot weather reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature Money-saving tips
Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately A well-designed 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year or $11 a month
If you have a house which heat penetrate easily your unit will have less heat to remove Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and won the first battle In a new house generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution If the house you plan to buy or build have big overhangs you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises fences and awnings
Shade trees too are a big help so keep them if you can Drawn blinds and draperies do some good but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house
The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof the greater its heat impact The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling going to need A shift in the walls or a change in the roof slope so the sun hits them more obliquely can save you money
You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house easier to shade there An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space and using an electric range instead of a gas one Gas adds to the moisture load
Insulate weatherstrip double-glaze to the maximum In insulation the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling 4 inches in the side walls 2 inches in the floors Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent
It costs two to three times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter so every solitary BTU is worth attention foil them in droves along with their pal humidity by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan a bathroom ventilator for when you shower and an outside vent for the clothes drier Keeping conditioners quiet
no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum Good workmanship is important in the installation so if doing your own contracting award the job on the basis of price alone
Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom

Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning This is particularly true in site selection You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are you must have a list of requirements on where how many and what type sites are needed With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society Washington 25 D. C. In recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land
Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions the exposure to the sun and wind the water interests etcetera which vary greatly with the seasons It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site These are a great aid for planning use back at the office
For site planning work it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study However there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation County judges commissioners engineers assessors and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area
How much study is required This of course depends on the character of the site itself the previous experience of the investigator and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use
In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements you need information to compare the site with others You need answers to four important questions
What are the existing recreation features
How well can the site be developed
How useful will it be to the public
Is this site available
Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site Naturally a park site with scenic views a good lake trees and sand dunes will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes Quality is vitally important Frontage on a body of clear clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water Some recreation features such as scenic values and water interest also have greater overall value than other interests
One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake colorful rock formations or unusual trees A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy
Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean stream or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing fishing boating and other water sports A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life
The amount of water frontage the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation afforded by it are important A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use The quantity of water flow may be critical a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer If the site is on a reservoir the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied Check the quality of the water A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area Other factors such as water temperature depth of water the fish life it supports wave action flooding etcetera will affect its recreation value
Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests canyons mountains deserts seacoast beaches sand dunes waterfalls springs etcetera with which the area is blessed Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area Although the site may not contain the features themselves there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site
The fish animals and birds which may be found at the site are another interest Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found quantity and size the season they are available and the stocking program of the fish commission Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life Clams crabs and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas
Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in The historical sign tells its story but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations deposits or shapes of the earth's crust in your region Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites An old shipwreck a high dam an old covered bridge a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold etcetera may be of interest Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas caves artifacts etcetera
How well can the site be developed Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use what can be done to correct the faults and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites Many things need to be checked
size and shape The size of the area alone can be a determining factor An area may be too small for the needs of the project Areas should be large enough to include the attractions have ample space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones
Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions However a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail or include scenic strips within the park unit
Adjoining areas The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands ownership and use of the land and the utilities available there For instance a site adjoining other publicly owned lands such as a national forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site
Topography Topography is very important Check the elevation of the ground degree and direction of slopes drainage rock outcrops topsoil types and quality as well as subsoil Nearly level areas are required for parking areas beaches camp areas ballfields etcetera Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be
Water In addition to its recreation interests water is needed for drinking sanitation and irrigation The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas
Plants The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking Look at the trees as to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy they are the problems of maintenance fire hazards wind throw etcetera
An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value other areas of brush may need to be cleared The extent and location of open areas is noted
Exposure How much will wind rain sun and temperature affect the use An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use The direction velocity and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable Sometimes you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended
Improvements Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings roads utilities cleared land etcetera which may raise the cost of the site

Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure because I admire the music of Prokofieff and with sober purpose because the development of Prokofieff personifies in many ways the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay witty mercurial full of pranks and bonheur and very capable as a professional musician These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 era Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was indeed brilliant
Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties To the Traditionalists it was a brilliant satire on modernism to the Neo-Classicists it was a challenge to the pre-war world What was it to Prokofieff A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times a brilliant piece de resistance Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon
I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 All musical Paris was there Some musicians were enthusiastic some skeptical I myself was one of the skeptics 35 years ago I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer shouting in his high-pitched voice it may be a tour de force mais mon Dieu can anyone take this music seriously
The answer is Yes Certainly America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously and with a good deal of pleasure His life-long friend Serge Koussevitzky gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston New York and Washington D.C. to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation Chicago was also a welcome host there in 1921 Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto Uncle Sam was indeed a rich uncle to Prokofieff in those opulent post-war victory years of peace and prosperity bold speculations and extravaganzas enjoyment and pleasure The Golden Twenties We attended the premieres of his concertos symphonies and suites we studied taught and performed his piano sonatas chamber music gavottes and marches we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers
Nevertheless Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff Stravinsky Koussevitzky Cocteau Picasso the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms
So young Prokofieff was the darling of success in his motherland in the spacious hunting grounds of Uncle Sam in the exciting salons of his lovely brilliant Paris mistress of gaiety excess and abandon world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone color dance design and thought
Meanwhile three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing In this world-wide conscription of men minds and machines Prokofieff was recalled to his native land The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty and the outraged freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission After this holocaust a changing world occupied the minds of men a world beset with new boundaries new treaties and governments new goals and methods and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation hunger and exposure
In this changed world Prokofieff settled to find himself and to create for large national purpose Here this happy roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world Here Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism producing music for the masses
It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous
But no Prokofieff grew He accepted the environment of his destiny took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody This is precisely what makes lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose the clarity must be new not old How right he was how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words with torrents of powerful music Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big muscular passionate and eloquent Fifth Symphony or the Love For Three Oranges gay as it is with the wonderful imaginative colorful and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet The Stone Flower This masterpiece has gaiety too but it is the gaiety of dancing people earthy salty and humorous
Of course these works are not comparable even though the same brain conceived them The early works were conceived for a sophisticated international audience the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens However in all of Prokofieff's music young or mature we find his profile his signature his craftsman's attitude Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se In orchestration he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating witty clever adroit and subtle His counterpoint is pertinent skillful and rarely thick
Also it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations the brilliant orchestrations the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema where a large dramatic canvas of sound was required That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears may or may not indicate that he was less of an original than we prefer to believe Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability
Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero who by the force of his creative life helped preserve the main stream of tradition to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated
At this date it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History as an effective Traditionalist who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation and used it as it served his purpose yet was never caught up in it never a slave to its academic dialectics Certainly it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World not his experimentations
So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better or even as well under different circumstances His fellow-countryman Igor Stravinsky certainly did not Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity while Stravinsky who leaped into fame like a young giant dwindled in stature and fruitfulness I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words the clarity must be new not old When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose he shaped his talents to his purpose
When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures many salons many dialectics many personalities he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles determined by many disparate cultures Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people by the compass of their national ideas But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting In all his miscalculations Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations representing many peoples time periods and styles into his own music by warping the harmony melody or form to verify his own experiments Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials and his flair for orchestrations his brilliant Petruchka his savage Sacre Printemps his incisive Les Noces the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed
But time is running out and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself Supra-Expressionism Neo-Paganism Neo-Classicism Neo-Romanticism Neo-Jazz Neo-Ecclesiasticism Neo-Popularism and most recently Post-Serialism all competing with each other within one composer What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem The Star-Spangled Banner a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto a circus polka for elephants his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs Stravinsky nearing the age of eighty is like a lost and frantic bird flitting from one abandoned nest to another searching for a home
How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction In the process his native endowments were stretched strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose
With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique he wove the materials of national heroes and events national folklore and children's fairy tales Slavic dances and love songs into a solid musical literature which served his people well and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large
Of course it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him time and economic security symphony orchestras opera and ballet companies choruses chamber music ensembles soloists recordings broadcastings television large and eager audiences It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunities incisive idioms social fermentations for a new national ideology a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose
Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century That his moods even in his early years are those of his people does him honor as his music honors those who inspired it That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture and perhaps of even greater significance his music is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music
April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash observed its 30th anniversary

Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman And like this English master Mason realizes his subjects in large simplified masses which though they seem effortless are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them
As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors its tang of weather its change of seasons its variable moods His father a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature Out of this background of hunting and fishing it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best hunters in the field fishermen in the stream ducks and geese on the wing almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors
Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting Like many others he had to work hard long hours in a struggling family business which though it was allied to art of a kind the design and production of engraved seals bore no relation to the painting of pictures But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art and later for twelve years he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia On the death of their father they returned to their home in Batavia New York After more years of concentrated effort Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand
During all this time Roy continued to paint first only on weekends and then as the family business permitted for longer periods Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether and for the past thirty years he has worked independently as a painter except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions But even on these the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off
Except for a rich friendship with the painter Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had and this was limited to a few lessons though the two artists often went on painting trips together Roy developed his art by himself In the best tradition he first taught himself to see then to draw with accuracy and assurance and then to paint He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor and his first public recognition and early honors including his election to the Academy were for his essays in the heavier medium Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major if not exclusive technique
It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions mostly in the vicinity of Batavia More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed not imitative painting What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition and that over-all amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done Inspiring yes instructive maybe duplicable no
But for the technical fact we have the artist's own testimony
Of late years I find that I like best to work out-of-doors First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale approximately Af inches in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values the lightest light the middle tone and the darkest dark by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture I try to place them in the initial sketch For me these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose
I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him as a result such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting unless the position serves the design of the whole composition If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design often only slightly finer pictures would result Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees logs and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position which I call clicking
Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition
If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition I mean to project equal concern for color Often in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright too dull or too light or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat When this occurs I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor if I have been working on a full sheet in the field
When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal When this linear draft is completed I dust it down to a faint image From this point I paint in as direct a manner as possible by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage However first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described Then I plan my attack the parts I will finish first the range of values the accenting of minor details all in all mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness The longer I work the more I am sure that for me at least a workmanlike method is important Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting
As for materials I use the best available I work on a watercolor easel in the field and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain In my studio I work at a tilt-top table but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers but prefer an English make rough surface in 400-pound weight After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws even the best sometimes has foreign nubbins on its surface I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean cold water Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board
In addition to the usual tools I make constant use of cleansing tissue not only to wipe my brushes but to mop up certain areas to soften edges and to open up lights in dark washes The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio
My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists for I combine the sable and the bristle The red sables are 8 two riggers 6 and 10 and a very large flat wash brush The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge
My usual palette consists of top-quality colors alizarin crimson orange raw sienna raw umber burnt sienna sepia cerulean blue cobalt blue French ultramarine blue Winsor green Hooker's green 2 cadmium yellow pale yellow ochre Payne's gray charcoal gray Davy's gray and ivory black
In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here True a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention this artist's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate
Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes a foreground in sharp focus either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights a middle distance often containing the major motif and a background usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky In following this general principle Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background and the illusion of depth is instantly created
When painting Mason's physical eyes are half-closed while his mind's eye is wide open and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory his imagination his nostalgia It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment His pictures generalize though they are inspired by a particular locale they universalize in terms of weather skies earth and people By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all
The artist was born in Gilbert Mills New York in 1886 and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California he lived in western New York in Batavia When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist the water sign of Pisces February 18 thru March 20 And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again in his natal month of March
Over the years beginning in 1929 Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals two Ranger Fund purchase awards the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal two American Watercolor Society prizes the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor Art Institute of Chicago and others in Buffalo New York Chautauqua New Haven Rochester Rockport and most recently the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association
He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society Philadelphia Water Color Club Allied Artists of America Audubon Artists Baltimore Watercolor Society

The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason they were better They were better trained better looking better built better disciplined and something else they were better dancers Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics
But why gymnastics at all And is the sport really important After all we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition But if it is important what can we do to improve ourselves It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem for just as gymnastics can learn from dance dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics
Taking first things first understand the sport called gymnastics It is made up of tumbling which might be said to start with a somersault run through such stunts as headstands handstands cartwheels backbends and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games The parallel bars horse buck springboard horizontal bar rings and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball volleyball basketball and football
But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one endurance The gymnast must develop strength flexibility coordination timing rhythm courage discipline persistence and the desire for perfection In short gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well The addition of endurance training later when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury provides that final quality that makes the top athlete soldier or citizen
Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries In most sports as in most walks of life the angels are on the side of those who begin young and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him The American is very lucky if he has three
If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension since action relieves both Oddly enough it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty Certainly there would be less anxiety fewer accidents it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries and higher scholastic averages since alert children work better Russia knows this and that is why there were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people
And what has dancing to do with all this A great deal Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus Well-stretched trained in posture and coordinated movement and wedded to rhythm they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace They were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing the slender lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle
President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation If we wait until children are in junior high or high school we will never manage it To be fit one has to start early with young children and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible we will be that much ahead School teachers all too unprepared for the job they must do will need demonstrators There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand and also how to help other children learn it They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught
Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility
Very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility Dancers do have flexibility They often fail however to develop real abdominal back chest shoulder and arm strength Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results considering the amount of physical training they have had will be very disappointing Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas This surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America chin themselves once and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test even dashes and endurance The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw
The chinning bar For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone and a chair should be placed under it a little to one side Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it Those who are too weak should climb on the chair and starting at the top of the chin let themselves slowly down When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to chin-up Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home
The horse kick Arm shoulder chest upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse kick Start on hands and feet Keeping the hands in the starting position run in place to a quick rhythm After this has become easy use slower and slower rhythms kicking higher and higher Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours kicking as high as possible
Push-ups Push-ups are essential but few have the strength for them at first Start on the knees in a large circle Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor Push back up and repeat Do this exercise six times each class period As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet and as strength improves fall farther and farther out Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide Let the body down slowly taking at least five seconds for the letting down Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up
Handstands Handstands come after arms chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength Of course those who have developed more will find them easier Start with the class standing in a circle with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone and those who need help Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back The left will follow at once The right will land first followed by the left Return to the standing position Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg The child should then bring both legs together overhead point the toes and tighten the seat muscles Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time
Backbends The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics and as with all acrobatics the sooner begun the better the results Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent Place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears fingers pointing toward the shoulders Arch the back upwards to make a bridge Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling As flexibility improves the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover
Back circle To further increase back flexibility work on the back circle Have the class lie prone Place the hands in front of the chest Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed Straighten the arms slowly this arches the back At the peak of the arch tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head
Somersaults The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault or forward roll This used to be part of every child's bag of tricks but few children can do it today some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright For most small children learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can After it has been seen have the child start on a mat on hands and knees a thin inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling He places the hands on either side of the head keeping the chin down on the chest He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo If however the child is weak overweight or afraid more help will be needed When the child raises his seat into the air the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis then no matter what happens the child's performance will be controlled By lifting the seat upwards a little the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded
These are beginnings but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong flexible body we are not talking of eccentric extremes Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal the good tumbler will be a better dancer a better athlete and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity
It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative And dancing school so helpful in artistic and psychological development also contributes to this essential early training and can contribute even more

Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics We have noted how some electronic techniques developed for the defense effort have evenutally been used in commerce and industry The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment the prospect is staggering The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that in this area alone the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery We use the term bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research
Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine the electrocardiograph and the diathermy machine Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises contusions and simple bursitis
Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction along with radiation counters timers and similar devices
In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research
Ultraviolet microscopy Many cells bacteria and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results
Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute By combining the talents of a medical man Dr. Aterman a biophysicist Mr. Berkely and an electronics expert Dr. Zworykin this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes
Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror the specimen is magnified by the microscope Instead of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the TV camera does the looking The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which means that all lenses must be quartz
The video signal is amplified and then switched in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength corresponding to red green or blue is seen Note Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor This assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry This is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths
Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth of detail
At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it
Breathing electronically analyzed The medical title of Lobar Ventilation In Man by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process At the University of Washington Medical School the electronics group has developed the Respiratory Gas Analyzer shown in Fig. 3 This unit affectionately dubbed The Monster can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing
In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung the total volume of inhalation per breath the flow of air from both lobes and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill standing still or in some other medically significant position From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail
Heart-measuring techniques The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta dimensioning of the heart and its chambers and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat For many of these measurements the chest must be opened but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed
A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube filled with mercury around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed
Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation In addition to the heart and aorta successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique The Doppler effect using ultrasonic signals can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel
A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder From this doctors can read heart rate change in diameter pressure and effective heart power
Radio-transmitter pills Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm. in diameter Battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8 to 30 hours maximum
A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute In this novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer As shown in Fig. 4 an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc. bursts The energy received by the pill causes the resonant circuit to ring on after the burst and this ringing takes place at the resonant frequency of the pill These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and after the pill has been calibrated precise internal pressure indications can be obtained
One of the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the patient for several days permitting observation under natural conditions Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments
Sonar in medical research One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects Various methods of pulsing scanning and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines map ocean floors and even communicate under water In medicine the frequencies are much higher transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller and different scanning techniques may be used but the principles involved are the same as in sonar
Because the body contains so much liquid transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals Based on this phenomenon a number of investigators have used this method to look through human organs A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6 The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath not shown For display Dr. Baum uses a portion of an Af an airborne radar indicator and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record
A typical sonogram of a human eye together with a description of the anatomical parts is shown in Fig. 5 The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan just like a radar antenna while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corners The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period
Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck as shown in Fig. 7 as well as many other hitherto impossible insights As mentioned before bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center Arteries and veins are apparent by their black blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls

Oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14 1777 His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family let alone educate them in a town without even a school The two older boys Hans and Anders his junior by a year therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg the wigmaker and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading German and Danish in the informal curriculum Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned such as the pastor to supplement the simple teaching From the town surveyor Hans learned drawing and mathematics and from a university student some academic subjects The mayor of the town taught them English and French Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other they read every book that they could borrow in the village At 12 Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life
In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen founded in 1479 and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine physics and astronomy his brother studied law The brothers continued to help each other during their studies sharing a joint purse lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt They supplemented their income by small government assistance by tutoring and economizing wherever they could So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote to be perfectly free the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination there is a struggle there in which if he falls it is easy for him to rise again there is freedom of utterance there which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty gained a new truth or banished a previous error He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science In this third year at the university Hans in 1797 was awarded the first important token of recognition a gold medal for his essay on Limits Of Poetry And Prose He completed his training in pharmacy also taking his degree with high honors in 1797 and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices
Ferment of scientific activity Hans' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent
The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university He was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis The following year he devoted to the customary Wanderjahr traveling in Germany France and the Netherlands meeting the philosophers Schelling Fichte and Tieck He also met Count Rumford born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn Mass. who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria and the physicist Ritter these were Oersted's main contacts in science
From Gottingen 1801 where he stayed for 10 days he wrote The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes in Copenhagen I used 30 and intend to carry it with me Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks continuing their correspondence after he left With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3,000 francs The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him In May 1803 Ritter in another flight of fancy wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries Thus 1745 corresponded to the invention of the Leiden jar by Kleist 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke 1782 produced the condenser of Volta and 1801 the voltaic pile Ritter proceeded You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 you will have to reckon This we might well witness Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it
In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist However he continued experimenting and lecturing publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University though not realizing full professorship ordinarius until 1817
During Oersted's attendance at the university it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences He was however fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey 1769-1842 teacher of chemistry who in addition to his academic chair was also proprietor of the Lion Pharmacy in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation In 1800 Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy In February 1801 Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead In the following year 1803 Oersted simultaneously with Davy discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts Eager as he was to pursue this promising line he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to galvanizing
He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level His broad interest in literary political and philosophical movements opened many doors to him His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong
The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation Paris 1813 under the title Recherches Sur Forces chimiques et electriques a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated Chapter 8 is entitled On Magnetism and in it are included such remarks as One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison It is true that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form There forces are more latent than in electricity and less than in magnetism But in such an important question we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty and not a thing which is contrary to it One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature just as electrical bodies do It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb By that one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces An attempt should be made to see if electricity in its most latent stage has any action on the magnet as such His plan and intent were clearly charted
Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship He continued as a popular lecturer He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current
In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm one of the Danish islands being one of three scientists in the expedition It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition Lauritz Esmarch that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow Together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper thereby producing stronger currents Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery
Discovery of electromagnetism the association between electric both electrostatic and voltaic forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles In the late 1700's Beccaria and Van Marum among others had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive possibly because he had like other experimenters laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it
The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle

Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk The selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation cost of materials available locally and your own preference No one material is best for all situations Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem
Fence-line feeding
Animals eat only from one side so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk These bunks also serve as a fence so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence Because of their location on the edge of the feed lot fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal Filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations
All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall

Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs.
Why Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies in modern equipment and new processes enlarged R & D facilities faster new product development Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling distribution and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge
Given this kind of business climate what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. Based on our experience with clients we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups the market place itself marketing methods and marketing management
1 Problems in the market greater price-consciousness
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years there is every indication it will continue Frequently wittingly or unwittingly price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers distributors and dealers Despite generally good levels of income we see greater price pressures than ever before traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer
Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target
Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse Have you actually checked out not just mentally tested different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem Increased customer sophistication
Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company Greater demand for services
Need for service is here to stay and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties There are two reasons for this First most products tend to become more complex Second in a competitive market the customer feels his weight and throws it around
Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction
Good service starts with product design and planning Many products seem to be designed for a production economy not for a service one Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization and your distributor organizations not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations
Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention Wider discretionary choices for customers
In spending his money today the consumer is pulled in many directions To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product the purchase of which can be switched delayed or put off entirely the implications are important Your competition is now proportionately greater you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products
Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole discretionary buying area Geographic shift of customers
The trends have been in evidence for many years population shifts to the Southwest and Far West and from city to suburbs These shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs. Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation strength of distributor organizations and even plant location Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts
We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry at both the manufacturing and retail ends Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts
The change may require different products pricing packaging warehousing salesmanship advertising and executive attention practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted Have you examined these trends forecast the effects and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances
2 Problems in marketing methods more private label competition
In the area of private label competition it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits which is in effect what the sale of private brands tends to do
Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded Moreover the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality and the customer seems to have caught on
If you are up against private brand competition have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position If private brand competition been felt in your product field as yet have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear Less personal salesmanship
Display merchandising backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion will continue to make strides in the sixties It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program
How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important If you have a higher-quality product how can you make it stand out justify its premium price without the spoken word Salesmanship is still necessary but a different brand of salesmanship
Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers Higher costs of distribution generally
Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved
The use of bulk handling is continuously growing Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels Selective selling concentrating sales on the larger accounts has been used effectively by some manufacturers
There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully and with some imagination In your sales force will a smaller number of higher-priced high-quality salesmen serve you best or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen
Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share In one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. As a result distribution costs were cut customer relations improved
Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job Higher costs of advertising and promotion
From the manufacturer's point of view the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods and private label competition
How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program Are you following competition willy-nilly trying to match dollar for dollar or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program from the standpoint of effort money and effectiveness Increasing tempo of new product development
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products
If competition beats you to it this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store On the other hand the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive As markets become larger and marketing more complex the costs of an error become progressively larger
Is your R & D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market Are there regular communications from the field or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R & D people Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing but useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume production and distribution costs and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans and management make up its mind
3 Problems in marketing management shortage of skilled salesmen
There is a shortage of salesmen today In the future quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy and the qualitative need will be greater still
While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel much of it has been product rather than sales training Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements
Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future both quantitatively and qualitatively Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs. Shortage of sales management talent
With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition sales management whether at the district region or headquarters level is a tough job today and it will be tougher in the future Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties
Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people Complexity of complete marketing planning
Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning Hip-pocket tactics are going to be harder to apply Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis They have to be With greater investments in plant facilities with automation growing you switch around either in volume or in product design as much as was formerly possible or at least not as economically
Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning
Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team Do you have a long-term 5- or 10-yr. marketing program
The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company's marketing problems realistically Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems whether they be in the market in marketing methods or in marketing management
If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade

The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that therefore the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building
Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables workshops or panel discussions whatever they are called on this subject will recognize that the final boiled down crux of the matter is education
It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses some even have six or more The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification however would demand a prolonged study of structure This would naturally lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training
We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject The real question that follows is how are those four years used and what is their value as training
The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art and a further on the spot inspection of a number of schools show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions
The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities Obviously the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated
Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses architecture versus interior design let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer
To begin with what is an interior designer The Dictionary Of Occupational Titles published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows Designs plans and furnishes interiors of houses commercial and institutional structures hotels clubs ships theaters as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture floor coverings wall decorations and determines color schemes
Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval Makes necessary purchases places contracts supervises construction installation finishing and placement of furniture fixtures and other correlated furnishings and follows through to completion of project
In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers expects that when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings
This seems like a large order The interior designer then must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society
Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise
The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations Yet even here many a problem is presented as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command design a luxury apartment no description of the client or his cultural level no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities simply a luxury apartment Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design
It is possible of course to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel of real interior design demands Unfortunately the purely synthetic problem is the rule
It is like medical schools in India where in that fairy-land of religious inhibition the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience
In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable
Consultation with architects clients real estate men fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work Fortunately although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow that the student already is in the trade
Even the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides Here too the reality of actual furniture must be experienced
The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers National Society of Interior Designers Home Fashions League and various trade associations can and do aid greatly in this work Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations
Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject
Participation for the educator in this case however would have to be raised to full and complete membership The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and indeed refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog
This anomalous status of the educator fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice
This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools That is in the continuance of the grandfather clauses in their membership requirements
When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth Long hard years of on the job training had brought them to their competence
The necessity of that day has long disappeared There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand
The reason and the day of grandfather clauses has long since passed No one can deny that these back door admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies
Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications
Nor will the hack the Jack-of-all-trades still found in some of the smaller art schools suffice
Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer
We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching minimal income and minimal status among their confreres
Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture furniture design textiles and color is also desirable
In all degree courses in interior design a number of academic or general studies courses are included It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English history psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art especially interior design as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here For proper accreditation of schools teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule at present be observed Indeed it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all The question however be ignored for long The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree Most professors in the course must naturally again have a higher degree than the course offers One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it
This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general Only the independent art schools that is those not connected with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department This plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department yet nevertheless claiming that they teach interior design has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design In spite of this many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject
There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation as do medical schools by an art accreditation group such as the National Association of Schools of Art
Independent art schools granting degrees must naturally follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group

General How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and consequently increased productivity
What effort do you make to assess results of your program Do you measure its relation to reduced absenteeism turnover accidents and grievances and to improved quality and output
Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication Is it reaching these goals Is it larger or fancier than you really need Are you using the most economical printing methods paper etc. Are there other cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted
Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess of free government work in your plant
Is your purchasing agent offering too much free-buying service for employees
When improvements are recommended in working conditions such as lighting rest rooms eating facilities air-conditioning do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity
When negotiating with your union do you make sure employees have a choice between new benefits and their cents-per-hour cost in wages
Can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those paid for by profit-sharing money such as was done in the union contract recently signed by American Motors Corporation
Insurance Do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance entitles them Are they encouraged to take full legal advantage of these benefits Have you publicized the cents-per-hour value of the company's share of insurance premiums
When did you last compare your present premium costs with the costs of insurance from other sources
Can your insurance company aid you in reducing administrative costs
Do you try to maintain the principle of employee-contributed as opposed to fully company-paid programs
Holidays time off overtime Do you protect your holiday privileges with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday
Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area and/or industrial patterns
Have you investigated the possibility of moving midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday in order to have an uninterrupted work week
Are you carefully policing wash-up time and rest periods to be certain that all other time is productive
Are you watching work schedules for boiler operators guards and other 24-hour-day 7-day-week operations in order to minimize overtime
Are you careful to restrict the number of people on leave at one time so that your total employment obligation is minimized
Plant feeding facilities Have you considered using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employees
What are the possibilities for operating your cafeteria for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift operations
Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria operation in order to save administrative costs
Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other jobs
Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facilities
Would it be feasible to limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs
Have you considered gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation
Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings or discussions
Recreation facilities Are your expenses in this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from your program
Have you audited your program recently to weed out those phases that draw least participation
Do employees contribute their share of money to recreational facilities
Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee association and carefully restricting your plant's financial contribution
Could an employee's garden club take over partial care of plant grounds Would a camera club be useful in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety
Are you spending too much money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees Are you underwriting expensive team trips
Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help pay for your program
Transportation and parking Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access roads and parking lots
If you use parking attendants can they be replaced by automatic parking gates
Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant
If you provide inter-plant transportation can this be replaced by available public transportation If you use company transportation to meet trains or to haul visitors would taxis be cheaper
How efficient and necessary are your intra-company vehicles Can they be re-scheduled Can part-time drivers be assigned to other productive work
Paid vacations Which is more economical for your plant a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees for vacation fill-ins
Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins
Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations during plant shutdowns
What can your sales and purchasing departments do to curtail orders shipments and receipts during vacation shutdown periods
Retirement Is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing your plant money
What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive Would early retirement of non-productive disabled employees reduce the number of make-work jobs
Will your union accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees
Medical and health Can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring plants
If you have a full-time doctor now can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case basis only
Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment
Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected health problems and avoid treating the latter
Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services flu shots sun lamp treatments etc.
If you have an annual or regular physical examination program is it worth what it is costing you
A program to fit your needs Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant
But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product there are other facts to consider How old is your working force your profit margin In what section of the country are you located Are you in a rural or urban area These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program
Above all set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will Unions stress fringe benefits but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time
Aim to balance your employee benefit package Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe say a liberal retirement plan and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere asking for union trouble
Communications If you want credit for your employee services program let your workers know what entitled to Encourage them to exercise their benefits This can be done by stories in your house organs posters special publications letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command
Some companies find a little imagination helpful Hallmark Cards Inc. Kansas City Mo. has a do-it-yourself quiz game called Benefit Bafflers which it distributes to employees M & R Dietetic Laboratories Inc. Columbus gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe U. S. Rubber Company New York passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package for example costs $227.72
Insurance Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible thereby alerting you to desirable revisions
Check to see if some of your benefits such as on-the-job disability pay can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates Also beware of open-end policies especially in the medical field This will mean that every time an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits
go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death Generally your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement
Special time off In granting bereavement leaves specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify Thus you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral Also reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that probably never use it
Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time If coffee is sold at the cafeteria let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers if you are supplying the coffee Otherwise you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers
Retirement policies Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan Younger men usually think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and liable to change jobs several times before settling down
Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans There are two sides of a coin for this decision Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to And they can at least collect the money they put in plus interest when they leave the company A non-contributory plan usually pay off for the worker until he retires Thus there is an added incentive to stay on the job
Holidays Make sure you pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working These include leaves of absences illnesses and layoffs
Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods For example the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups
Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay This cuts the absentee rate
Eating facilities Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices and at a profit to you If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria keep an eye out for quality and price If the soup tastes like dishwater your employees blame the concessionaire take the rap
Check your cafeteria location to make sure convenient for most employees You may save valuable production minutes with a change
Vacations Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks This will cut the expense of vacation replacements And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates
Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year

The long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away But with all the changes in philosophy dress and terrain a few things remain constant including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports hunting and fishing
As the generations move on clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports Sporting firearms change markedly for the better Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon the demand of today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment
The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders extremely accurate bolt lever and slide action firearms And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition designed for today's hunting and target shooting
And due to modern resource-use and game management practices there is still game to shoot even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water Present conservation practices regard wildlife not as an expendable natural resource but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states on shooting preserves one of the newer phases of modern game-management for five and six months each year
Close to two million game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines many national weeklies and the trade papers
The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954
Following the kick-off of SAAMI's shooting development program in 1954 a most interesting meeting took place in Washington D.C. The group known as the American Association for Health Physical Education and Recreation a division of the National Education Association initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association SAAMI and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project
The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact so often overlooked that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school and they are important to proper physical development But with the exception of professional athletes few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman
Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian Smith today thousands of secondary schools colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops at which hundreds of school administrators teachers professors and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach
In 1959 SAAMI's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports This program is now nationally known as Teen Hunter Clubs
Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation The first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss Hempstead New York under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis Other pilot programs were conducted by A & S Babylon New York J. L. Hudson Detroit Joseph Horne Pittsburgh
Other THC activities followed conducted by shopping centers department stores recreation equipment dealers radio-TV stations newspapers and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources SAAMI's field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans
Through the efforts of SAAMI's shooting development program these shooting activities and many others including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks trap and skeet leagues rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted to mention only a few
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation too many of our political social educational and even religious leaders too often forget it Help is needed from dealers at the grass-roots level
The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association Since SAAMI's conception in 1926 and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults We trust that you as a gun and ammunition dealer have benefited through additional sales of equipment
Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition
Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons
Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs shooting programs and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves Ask Sammy Shooter We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use
With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now There were umbrella tents wall tents cottage tents station wagon tents pup tents Pop tents Baker tents tents with exterior frames camper trailers travel trailers and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps
Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves lanterns coolers bedding games fishing tackle windbreaks and sunshades We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long National Seashore Recreation Area Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often look at the equipment and talk with the campers Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry
Camping is big and getting bigger No one knows where it will stop Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping The number depends on who is talking at the moment The figures range as high as 15 million families heard 10 million mentioned often but more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable
More campers than campsites Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space but families are being turned away especially on holiday weekends The National Parks always popular camping places are facing the same pressure The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day almost twice what there are at present The U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily
But the campers still come They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance
Why they keep coming There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds Among them according to the U.S. Department of Commerce are 1 shorter work weeks 2 higher pay 3 longer paid vacations 4 better transportation 5 earlier retirement and 6 more education The more people learn about their country the more they want to learn Camping is family fun and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before
But make no mistake about it the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford
The American Automobile Association computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 The AAA then splits it down this way $10.50 for meals $9.50 for lodging $7 for gas and oil and $2 for tips and miscellaneous
What does the camping couple do to this set of figures The $9.50 for lodging they save Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way
Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer they now think about how many vacations they can have Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year And even if they stay in resorts part of the time they might if the right salesman gets them in tow develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces
It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea buying the comforts of home not Home is the place to find the comforts of home buying fun and adventure and family experiences But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy Today's campers want comforts and they have them And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping fun and easy so easy that there is time left after cooking and tent keeping for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families
Camp meals are no great problem Neither are beds thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags Neither are shelters because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper
But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs

Throughout history the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others for good or bad Since the Industrial Revolution when factories emerged this classical pattern has been followed Until recently
There have always been tales of disillusionment the competent technician who became an administrator willingly or not and found he like it the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work and much more commonly in recent years the engineer who found that other duties interfered with or eliminated his engineering contributions There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology The remedies have been many and varied attempts to teach management techniques either in plant at special schools or in university crash courses provision of management-trained assistants or associates But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer Some men have no talent for or interest in management forcing them into management can only create trouble The old shop adage still holds A good mechanic is usually a bad boss
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures As several recent books have over-emphasized we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world
What can be done for the individual contributor who is extremely important and likely to be more so in the operation of the technically oriented company He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men and income tends to rise with title
Even the college professor in America has been affected It is as one engineer says indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course This leads one to conclude as you have that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers So we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the dual-road-up problem and more importantly their solutions In the paragraphs that follow we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page
First what title what setup
Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric This is not a mutually exclusive plan there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward Further the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path It is common to shift back and forth working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions
Actually there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide services operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities
Also moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert As examples at GE Glen B. Warren formerly manager of the Turbine Division widely recognized as a turbine designer The late W. R. G. Baker a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the Electronics Division and later by his own choice an individual consultant Harold E. Strang expert in switchgear design for a long period vp & gm of the Measurements & Industrial Products Division and who currently approaching retirement is vice-president and consulting engineer in the Switchgear & Control Division
In the GE plan a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers These positions carry such titles as
Consultant Advanced Development
Consulting Engineer
Consulting Engineer Heat Transfer
Consulting Electrical Engineer
Senior Electrical Engineer
Senior Physicist
Westinghouse has a similar system with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side consulting engineer or scientist as the case may be and advisory engineer or scientist Many companies have systems particularly in R & D which work more or less well depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations
Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is as one man says it that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach Senior staff engineer
One company instituted early in 1959 a vertical classification system consisting of four levels There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks the top non-supervisory level senior staff engineer enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision The second level senior engineer rates slightly below first-level supervision The expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level with very few coming from the first level
The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers but probably not into executive levels In this organization about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision engineering or elsewhere This reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products which are not military Several other examples central and satellite We have over 20 divisions each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer We have set up a central R & D department as well as engineering-management departments about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants A separate research department is of course confined to new or future designs Part of this headquarters staff however are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management These headquarters engineers headed by the vice-president Engineering counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions These men are considered managers of engineers They must learn to wear several hats so to speak working with management sales and engineering problems related to the product
We do not have people in our organization termed consultants or fellows who are specialists in one particular technical subject I suppose it is because we are just not big enough We have a few consultants retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems The only fellows in our company are those who have been honored by ASME AIEE or AIChE I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist because of his wider accountability Another structure We have tried to make both paths attractive so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either One way to formalize this is in the job structure We have these positions which compare directly Af
Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of Engrg R & Aj The latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side We have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president Top job research scientist Approximately four years ago we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons The highest position is known as a research scientist This approach has not been entirely satisfactory The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols support of the dual-ladder plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions
A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level With no set standards there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit If no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level the result is a department top-heavy with high-level high-salaried personnel Staff engineer dept. manager We have two approaches for the technical man the position of staff engineer which is rated as high in salary as department manager and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work These are only halfway measures and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige A complete plan We have made limited application of the parallel ladder plan The highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is research engineer The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision engineering section head We also have an engineering section head research engineer classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer Above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder
We also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a professional and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence These include encouragement of and assistance to the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies
A recent and more pertinent action has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering This function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title member of the technical staff Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management Additional symbols of status are granted such as reserved parking distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit
We presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status All scientific staff members will have the title research-staff member The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member therefore are not necessarily evaluated as highly
These recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts Fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that in the business community prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions

Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called Oakwood Heights As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation with principal offices in New York State Its president is Otis M. Waters partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters 540-K Chrysler Bldg. New York City Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors Inc. Newburgh N.Y.
The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada even overseas write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if feasible and where it is being done Its editors only knew of one example to point to a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March 1950 issue This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family
Common complaints included Mrs. Murphy leaving her windows open all the time a fresh air fan or the family was visiting Aunt Minnie with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil As a result of that attitude others have been discouraged from trying central distribution
A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights Called a Slo-Flo meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles a key individual being Don Nelson Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern principal heating states
an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer The earlier New Haven development was public housing so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture These have to do with property rights municipal official attitudes and a host of others In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally
It is always difficult or at least time-consuming to get approval of any kind of line under a public street as one example To overcome this the builder lays and completes the street himself then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State For the central storage Tri-State buys one acre Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece In other words the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State
How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan It leases the whole facility to a large oil company at least large enough to have a strong credit position This first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties
On this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons in two tanks or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies However that is not all he has to do He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups Again the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best
For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low
Initial considerations The officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles as well as personalities that might be affected For example the officials of Poughkeepsie town township where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing with fewer trucks in the residential streets
The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility subject to their many regulations
Several financial institutions both banks and insurance companies have been sounded out They like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil an obvious precaution since the account is permanently wedded just like with gas or electricity
For a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' X-Tru-Coat a product of Republic Steel Corp. and all lines are welded They are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some areas four feet down particularly under roads to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking The meter is mounted high on the basement wall Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read even into tenth gallons It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour
Ritter the builder is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available
It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods and an understatement The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple
Future plans What does Tri-State actually want to do now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the patent applied for stage It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects by financing and installing the storage piping and meters and leasing these for 15 years with renewal options to a strong oil company It may also work in one other way by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities
This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers for the idea has so often been mentioned somewhat wistfully But too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th others were building The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches and the town building inspector was paying a friendly if curious visit
The oilheating industry is looking up led by a revival of research and development A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark
Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around It pays in the long hot run to take good care of the water works Do it this way for the summer gargle
First drain that old coolant down the storm sewer save the anti-freeze even if it the expensive permanent type The word means it boil away easily nothing else The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year and you want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean Pitch it out
If a lot of rust shows in the drain use a good flushing cleaner
Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor Of course want to use the softest water you can in your radiators
Now check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections around the freeze-out plugs gaskets water pump seals and heater fittings
Next run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens and then look for leaks again Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins Use the air hose for this job Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working
If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as Dowguard be sure to check it Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer
Take precautions now to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer
let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours Spring and summer may be here officially but those thermos stay in
The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle will greatly increase the fuel consumption reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators
If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant
Are you paying too much for your truck insurance a good chance you are doubling on some coverage not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut
Have a talk with your insurance agent Be careful that you keep adequate coverage but look for places to save money First go over the type of coverage you now have Look for these features which may mean you can save
Duplicate coverage Avoid doubling up on the same item For example pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy
Does your policy have a lay-up clause This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you This applies to repair work of winter storage
The figure five is important in insurance With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs This means either cars or trucks Discounts run up to 2% of cost
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan For example If your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 a 25% premium saving is often made

In the period since the end of World War 2 a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful the unusual and the original in signs and displays plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry however is not in terms of volume alone Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries Many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons medallions etc. owes much to the field as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below The concept of trans-illumination as shown by the photo on p. 92 as just one example offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems no matter what industry is involved
A volume market According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales Five years ago they had only 10% of the market with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing And far from the end for plastics Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. Los Angeles Calif. Four years ago the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs today 85% is in plastics
From the volume standpoint the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive Aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million Currently there are some 6000 companies in the field ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal electrical and plastic components
Why the trend to plastics
What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field Out of many factors which might be cited five are most important 1
Plastics combine such properties as built-in color light weight optional transparency or translucency resistance to corrosion as well as the ease of fabrication 2
Plastic signs are economical According to one major producer materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit Shipping cost is also reduced a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb. compared to 275-300 lb. for neon The weight advantage plus greater durability of the plastic unit yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed Finally maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs 3
They offer exceptional design freedom making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics Pre-decoration low-cost molds and the freedom to form large and small thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry 4
Plastic signs work around the clock Internal illumination protected from the elements gives them powerful visual appeal at night during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest 5
Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques ranging from injection molding for intricate smaller-size mass-production signs generally 5000 units is the minimum to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding What plastics to use
For outdoor signs and displays acrylic with its outstanding optical characteristics weather resistance and formability strongly dominates the picture At present both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total See panel p. 166 for a comparison
Of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's Polychemicals Dept. of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as Monocite H 100 which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass is impervious to all kinds of weather and will not yellow Its high impact strength even at low temperatures resists chipping cracking and crazing according to Du Pont
Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs background panels and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness ease of forming and excellent weathering properties Its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign see MPl Mar. 1961 p. 98
For specialized types of displays such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product package human or animal figures etc. reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used
A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs see below
For outdoor signs and displays where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor the choice of plastics is almost unlimited Here may be found regular and impact styrene cellulose acetate cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate acrylic vinyl expandable styrene foam and polyethylene The final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs method of fabrication degree of complexity number of units required time available for tooling and projected life expectancy of the unit Often the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques
Trans-illuminated billboards One of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co. Los Angeles and Industrial Electric Inc. New Orleans La.
The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former constructed of translucent plastic panels are lighted from within With the source of light behind the copy there is no loss of lumen output as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light Also the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and obstruct the view of the sign
The copy itself including any text or illustrations is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process The film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied
Signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities and others are on the way It is believed that these boards will within the next few years replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use
Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions As used by Industrial Electric Inc. the film panels are printed one at a time as are 24-sheet posters Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces In this way the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media
Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials a revolving spectacular sign Comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec. of viewing time for each poster subject Sixteen panels each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide make up the 25-ft. length of the sign
Changeable letters fill many needs Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field changeable signs
Signs are meant to convey a message and in most cases this requires words and letters Frequently the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products price changes etc. The huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters in all shapes and sizes and a number of companies are set up to supply them Here are some of the newer items currently available
Poster Products Inc. Chicago Ill. a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors onto which are mounted snap-in letters figures or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock The background which is available in various widths and continuous lengths is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely
The Adaptaplex Co. Beaverton Ore. letters molded of butyrate available in several sizes in either red or black Ideal for merchandising use they are weather-resistant and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel
For large letters e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate there are other techniques For example in a typical store installation fifty 24-in. and six 36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings its ends twisted behind the panels
Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations Wagner Sign Service Inc. Chicago for example supplies them in several colors in heights of 4 6 8 10 and 17 inches They are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars extruded of transparent acrylic material which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters
Still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products Azusa Calif. This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in. or smaller panels formed of 0.080-in. clear butyrate sheet stock masked and sprayed on the rear side Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum which may be mounted to various surfaces The sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co. Los Angeles Calif.
On large-area units where additional structural requirements are imposed one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels e.g. right-angled corrugations of the acrylic or butyrate Joined side by side such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels painted on the first surface or handled in other ways

New rule no. 2 build from the outside in try to build from the inside out
insert your components into fixed openings they may or may not fit position your components before you close them in For example
wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place
Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub Af through a narrow doorway
Finish your plumbing before you frame it in most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes
Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet
position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one two three order first the stud on one side then the window then the stud on the other side
Install your disappearing stair or stairs to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling
close in your house until everything has been carried in Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof
No auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block And trailer makers those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out
New rule no. 3 rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you
This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all because 1
It makes it easy to handle much heavier units so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside 2
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that like earthmoving and roadbuilding should be lower today than in 1929 3
It changes the answers to Who should do what and where It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication where almost everything can be made better and cheaper 4
It changes the answers on when to do what at the site For example instead of putting in your driveways last as many builders do you can now save money by putting them in first Instead of closing the house in first as most builders do you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to see p 121 5
It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by buying direct and short-cutting the dealer But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed drywall inside the house siding along the sides trusses on the walls roofing on the roof etc.
Says Clarence Thompson We dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier The revolution is well under way but much more remains to be done Five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily
Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads
So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling most of it inefficient add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing
That House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling says Clarence Thompson long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer carrier equipment maker dealer and builder all working together to cut the cost of materials handling Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem Here is where things stand today 1
Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized There are few areas left where a builder find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it 2
Practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling including lumber asphalt shingles glass block face brick plaster lime hardboard gypsum wallboard and sheathing cement insulation sheathing floor tile acoustical tile plaster base and asbestos shingles 3
Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need For some significant new items see the pictures 4
More than 50% of all lumber is unitized an NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling Of these 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost Most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time says James Wright of Aj 5
Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments 48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high or six McCracken packets 24'' wide by nominal 7'' high These units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 bd/ft say 120,000 lb in a 50' box car much more than the average for loose-loaded cars 6
The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars First was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 lb later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast still pending elsewhere of $.07/cwt on 70,000 lb-plus carloads which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 lb 7
More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open These carriers cut handling costs for the dealer and the builder Says NRLDA's James Wright Since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment
The reason today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper So manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle the self-unloading carrier It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man the driver to unload it and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load can deliver it to the best spot in some cases right on the roof or inside the house and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it
Says Wright Our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles
New rule no. 4 Restudy what your men do to help them waste less of the time you pay for Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip
Even America's most efficient builder Bob Schmitt of Berea hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works Already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion
Builder Eddie Carr of Washington past president of NAHB cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the SCR masonry process worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient easy-to-spot 100-brick packages The SCR process with its precision corner-posts its precision guide lines its working level scaffold and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day See page 156
One good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew Reports Jim Lendrum By studying men on the job we found that two men a carpenter and a helper can lay a floor faster than three We found that three men two carpenters and a helper can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men because four men make two teams they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job five men not four is the magic number
No house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled
New rule no. 5 waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud
This is the most penny-wise pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit
Green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum But now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels green lumber is an anachronism you afford
Green studs cost about $.65 dry studs cost less than $.03 more So if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud

There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves but away from the crowds and common happenstance If travelled in Europe a time or two it is quite certain that had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic Following a guide and gratefully so is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new However after seen all the historical piazzas and plazas the places and forums the churches and museums the palaces and castles and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will far from the market places
The champagne at Troyes the traditional capital of the champagne country has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour You can relive history and follow in fancy the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot And you meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages Time stands still as you climb the narrow stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns perched atop lofty crags their faces turned to the sea been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean
An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road
For those who need or want and can afford another car buying one and driving it on the grand tour then shipping it home is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage Then of course there are those of us who either do not want or need or afford another car The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one It is that elemental
Almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you You can call one of the car rental services directly Hertz Avis Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental and others and ask them to reserve a car of your choice and some transportation lines offer this service as well With few exceptions your car will be waiting for you at dockside airport railroad station or hotel when you arrive oftentimes at no additional cost You can wait of course until you arrive in Europe before renting your car The disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or during the busy tourist season when cars are in great demand you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all Since charges are relatively the same reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it
For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city or even another country when you are ready to return home At some cities this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge and if you are budget-wise when you are planning your itinerary you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries
International Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data A valid American driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal Spain Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe If you plan to visit any of these countries you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee around $3.00 Your insurance too with most agencies is provided with the car covering comprehensive fire theft liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries If you would feel happier with full collision insurance there is a small additional charge again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance The average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day The charge is variable however and goes as low as $.50 a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece
Rental fees are variable too throughout the countries of Europe There are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available As in the United States there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days
It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford Chevrolet or even a Cadillac which are available in some countries it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon
Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group With the exception of the sports cars even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation There is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries however including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee all that much greater than for the wee sedans
The basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car but some of them offer supplementary advantages There is the free intra-city rent it here leave it there service as an example the free delivery and collection at the airport dockside or your hotel luggage racks touring documents and information and other similar services A little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits The investigation will be well worth your time
All model cars are not available in all countries Quite naturally there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country If you would like to start your tour in Italy where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe Fiats in all sizes are available as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models If you wish to budget closely on transportation saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon seating six at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer If you will be using your car more than fifteen days which all unlikely the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon With six in the group the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee
In the majority of countries however the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger luxury European models with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12 The same model car might be available in six or eight countries yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven The variations are not too great Rates for American cars are somewhat higher ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high actually the highest in Europe and surprisingly enough they are also quite high in Ireland
If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a month it might be wise for you to lease a car The actual over-all cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time but you will receive a new car You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout Europe Further there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip There is a fairly wide selection of models of English German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7 Citroen 2 CV Volkswagens Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in Europe but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory After the first month rates are considerably less averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models
There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan For one thing the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road Then too European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them Still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of Europe by car The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car It as expensive as most people believe it to be
Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 a day but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800 The big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine
The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars However whether you arrange to have a European or American model if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger This will include your helpful English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day If you drive greater distances than that just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands Of course if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride have a memorable tour but it be cheap and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes
