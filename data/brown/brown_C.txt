It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin Certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high pale pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music or forever finds it closed
There was about that song something incandescent for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat Not the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious or even the most eloquent Those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point
That is when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing glittering and sometimes spitting Mr. Hendl could go along But Mr. Hendl does not go straight to any point He flounders and lets music sprawl There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra and music to ultimate fusion So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein but not great Brahms
The concert opened with another big romantic score Schumann's Overture to Manfred which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit It got the kind of scrambled coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style
Bayreuth next summer The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of Tannhaeuser staged by Wieland Wagner who is doing all the operas this time and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch Sawalisch also conducts The Flying Dutch opening July 24 Parsifal follows July 25 with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting and he also conducts Die Meistersinger to be presented Aug. 8 and 12 The Ring cycles are July 26 27 28 and 30 and Aug. 21 22 23 and 25 Rudolf Kempe conducts No casts are listed but Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano Grace Bumbry will sing Venus in Tannhaeuser
Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet Well now we have two big theaters But barring a miracle and hold your breath for it Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov Ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world
Before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times indeed we did The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in McCormick Place which Sol Hurok ballet booker extraordinary considers the finest house of its kind in the country and of course he weep at the capacity either
It was all set Allied Arts Corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10 Later the Hurok office made it Dec. 8 thru 17 a nice long booking for the full repertory But if you keep a calendar of events as we do you noticed a conflict Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec. 8 and 9 Something had to give Not La Dietrich Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking fly here to open Nov. 28 and close Dec. 2 Shorter booking but still a booking We printed it
A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake So I started making some calls of my own These are the results
The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium Los Angeles Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4 Not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 barring that miracle Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us Well Dietrich budge from McCormick Place Then how about the Civic Opera House Well Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4
Queried about the impasse Allied Arts said Better cancel the Kirov for the time being all up in the air again
So the Kirov will fly back to Russia minus a Chicago engagement a serious loss for dance fans and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country
Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium

H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called Hark Hark The Lark It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season
If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans it is hard to find Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics
Anyway a number of them meet here in devastating collisions One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm Another is a wily countryman called Larkin whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled I believe in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates' comedie humaine
up now Well Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities
They want to own a junior-grade castle or a manor house or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers
They are willing to settle however in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at And of course Larkin has just the thing they want
Splendor by sorcery a horror The name of it is Gore Court and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T. S. Eliot not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it though He conjures herds of deer and wild birds crowding the air
He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor The stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform The vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch
Larkin has an answer to all that The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids Also perhaps table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented
a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse He really need the immense sum of money probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange he makes them pay
For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot He has a glorious wife and many children When he needs money to buy something like say the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies One of those capital-gains ventures in fact has saddled him with Gore Court He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands
And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth
First one then the other If in Larkin's eyes they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living
Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war
First the Larkins are ahead then the Jerebohms After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers One of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's tales of India does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds
He think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish
It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' Don Quixote is the brilliant Russian spectacle done in wide screen and color which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses
More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire Sancho Panza in seventeenth-century Spain this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character
Nikolai Cherkasov the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible performs the lanky Don Quixote and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man
His addle-brained knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke is as Cervantes no doubt intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues
Cherkasov does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do He treats this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world
The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue The voices of all the characters including that of Cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform with the personalities And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish there is no violation of artistry or logic here
Splendid too is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev one of Russia's leading comedians as Sancho Panza the fat grotesque squire Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don he gives it a firmness and toughness a sort of peasant dignity too It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons
The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is one of the best in the film
True the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy
There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange
Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called Sunday In Greenwich Village a tour of the haunts and joints

Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family
There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time for example could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for Chicago And All That Jazz presented on NBC-TV Nov. 26
The program came out of the NBC Special Projects department and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines If so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents
As a matter of fact this latter approach has already been tried and with pleasing results A few years ago a Timex All-Star Jazz Show offered a broad range of styles ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland An enthusiastic audience confirmed the live character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance
About that same time John Crosby's TV series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work
Chicago And All That Jazz could not be faulted on the choice of artists Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden Gene Krupa Bud Freeman Pee Wee Russell Johnny St. Cyr Joe Sullivan Red Allen Lil Armstrong Blossom Seeley The jazz buff could hardly ask for more
Furthermore Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies He played host at the Timex show already mentioned
One of the script's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share For example there was sheet music with the word jazz in the title to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920's
However well chosen and cleverly arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business which considering the talent at hand should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style
Another source of NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse Similarly in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a close perusal
Chicago And All That Jazz may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today's artists the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either Still the network's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily anticipated
Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor Sunday night
The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic Mad Scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers
Her entrance in Scene 2 Act 1 brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note Thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization As she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of Lucia She topped the sextet brilliantly
Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the Mad Scene but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene A much more girlish Lucia a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her role What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today
This big flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined Nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly In the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous scene magnificently
Technically it was fascinating aurally spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable Her debut over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine
The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor Silvio Varviso He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult
Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable
Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959 The first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia She has since turned to Bellini whose opera Beatrice Di Tenda in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season She will sing La Sonambula with it here next week
Anyone for musical Ping-pong
really quite fun as long as you like games You will need a stereo music system with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and one or more of the new London Phase 4 records There are 12 of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the star release Pass In Review SP-44001 This features the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand Complete with crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of realism this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect
All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension to the music You definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound
London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects
Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word percussion or percussive Drums xylophones castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well Only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right They are definitely in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley
The Percussive Twenties SP-44006 stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day and Johnny Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods SP-44005 Big Band Percussion SP-44002 seemed one of the least attractive discs the arrangements just have so much character as the others
There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies The penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant but brassy piano sounds in Melody And Percussion For Two Pianos SP-44007 All of the releases however are recorded at a gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise Pass In Review practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system
Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic
Strange but true authenticity and realism often related at all
Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic in fact impeccably so In any given period piece the costumes bric-a-brac vehicles and decor bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity
The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter During the making recently of an important Biblical film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and complied with
But alas the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge The drama itself and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all The storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic
Thus in The Story Of Ruth we have Ruth Naomi and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline i.e. that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz the film version has little to do with the Bible
And in the new King Of Kings the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that be traced to the Gospels
Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow director of the United States Information Agency came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry
He talked about unauthentic storylines too He intimated that they doing the country much good in the Cold War And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism
In many corners of the globe he said the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge Yet for much of the globe Hollywood is just that prime if not sole source of knowledge If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone what conclusions do you think he might come to

Francois D'Albert Hungarian-born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College His pianist was Donald Jenni a faculty member at DePaul University
The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists so that for the first half of the program when the piano was partially open Mr. Jenni's playing was too loud In vying with him Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone
This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances however except in the case of the opening work Mozart's Sonata in A K. 526 which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion
Brahm's Sonata in A although also vigorous stood up well under the two artists' strong large-scale treatment Mr. D'Albert has a firm attractive tone which eschews an overly sweet vibrato He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance
A Sonata For Violin And Piano called Bella Bella by Robert Fleming was given its first United States performance The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada The work's two movements one melodically sentimental the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a Ravel-like style but they rehash a wornout idiom They might well indicate conjugal felicity but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood
Works by Dohnanyi Hubay Mr. D'Albert himself and Paganini indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase Standard items by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program
In recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium but her program last night at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist's first New York recital since 1948
Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control And the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound
Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure She played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures
The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best The Rachmaninoff Prelude No. 12 Op. 32 for instance gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble
The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured rich in color and songful And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs
Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses in which each variation was nicely set off from the others Haydn's Sonata in E minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and Chopin's Sonata in B flat minor A memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist's performance So what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing
All the generals who held important commands in World War 2 did not write books It only seems as if they did And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written One of the very best is only now published in this country five years after its first publication in England It is Defeat Into Victory by Field Marshal Viscount Slim
A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of those who finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves are more interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of course the Field Marshal himself
William Joseph Slim First Viscount Slim former Governor General of Australia was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma War He had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared ill-equipped British forces were outmaneuvered outfought and outgeneraled He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas Indians Africans Chinese and British And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war The Forgotten War his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines
Parts of Defeat Into Victory are a tangle of Burmese place names and military units but a little application makes everything clear enough On the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book Field Marshal Slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even a cardinal error He praises many individuals generously He himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers
Remaking an army to win Defeat Into Victory is a dramatic and lively military narrative But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action
Before he could return to Burma Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits His remarks about training discipline morale leadership and command are enlightening He believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many He believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there For general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly
Other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass British American and Chinese health hygiene medical aid and preventive medicine hospitals inadequate and nurses scanty food and military supplies logistics and transport airdrops and airstrips roads and river barges to be built
Expected of a commander Commenting on these and other matters Field Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks
When in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the bolder
The commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory for that is his duty
It only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you give them It depresses them So I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it
Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders Of the Japanese private he says He fought and marched till he died If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to kill 495 before it was ours and then the last five killed themselves
Brooding about future wars the Field Marshal has this to say The Asian fighting man is at least equally brave as the white usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him He is by background and living standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources
A bunch of young buckaroos from out West who go by the name of Texas Boys Choir loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience
Actually the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded and they sang it beautifully Under the capable direction of the choir's founder Geroge Bragg the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and Baroque madrigals and motets excerpts from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater and all of the Britten Ceremonial Of Carols
Their singing was well-balanced clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional waver and now and then a bleat
But Mr. Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior Most surprising of all he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words The Latin for example was not only clear it was even beautiful
Furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music Lines came out neatly and in good balance Tempos were lively The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish
A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly Other capable soloists included David Clifton Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson
The final group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume Boys will be boys and Texans will be Texans The combination proved quite irresistible last night
The Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze after the region of Poland where it has its headquarters opened a three-week engagement at the City Center last night A thoroughly ingratiating company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening
Not that it is all funny by any means though some of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome high-spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification
The material is all basically of folk origin gleaned from every section of Poland But under the direction of Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators and performed altogether professionally Under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training and an equally professional sense of performing
Since the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that this is not the original company it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters The stage is constantly full of them indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers They can be exuberant or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull
To pick out particular numbers is something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed There is for example a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera Strasny Dwor' may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see there is an enchanting polonaise and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men
Everywhere there are little touches of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth

The Theatre-by-the-Sea Matunuck presents King Of Hearts by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke Directed by Michael Murray settings by William David Roberts The cast
Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's King Of Hearts
The dialogue is sharp witty and candid typical eat the daisies material which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it
The story is of a famous strip cartoonist an arty individual whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material
This is when his troubles begin not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect to the hero's sweetheart-secretary
John Heffernan playing Larry Larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless
This may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint of David Hedison Providence's contribution to Hollywood who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role He does and more But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it has to be that way
A word should be said for Gary Morgan a Broadway youngster who as the adopted son makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular And for his playmate Francis Coletta of West Warwick who has a bit part Billy
On the whole audiences will like this performance It is a tremendous book lively constantly moving and the Matunuck cast does well by it
The Newport Playhouse presents Epitaph For George Dillon by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton directed by Wallace Gray
The cast
The angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse where Epitaph For George Dillon opened as the jazz festival closed
For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session mad at a world he did not make
Furthermore something of a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well
It is into this household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play
An unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists By the end of the third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other shells
Not altogether a successful play Epitaph For George Dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling It is awfully talky for instance and not all of the talk is terribly impressive But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten
There is a fine second act as an example one in which Samuel Groom as Dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another This is an exciting young actor to watch
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment
Also fine are Sue Lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive Harold Cherry as her scratchy spouse and Hildy Weissman as a vegetable in human form
Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste Still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance despair
The Warwick Musical Theater presents Charley With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser directed by Christopher Hewett choreography by Peter Conlow musical direction by Samuel Matlowsky The cast
Everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater and Shelley Berman was to blame
One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented Once In Love With Amy is also of course one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 got a rousing opening chorus Charley and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being
It is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called Charley's Aunt and let himself go with as appealing an Amy as anybody could ask
In brief Berman played himself and not Bolger The big audience started applauding even before he had finished
The whole production this week is fresh and lively The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days The ballet work is on the nose especially in the opening number by The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later
Berman whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist proved himself very much at home in musical comedy
Sparrow-size Virginia Gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile made a suitably perky Amy while Melisande Congdon as the real aunt was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner
All told Charley Ought not to be missed It has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right Mr. Berman
The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C. Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of Fiorello At Veterans Memorial Auditorium The book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott music by Jerry Bock lyrics by Sheldon Harnick choreography by Peter Gennaro scenery costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart musical direction by Jack Elliott and the production was directed by Mr. Abbott The cast
This is one of the happier events of the season
The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again
I saw Fiorello Performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good and perhaps better
Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley does but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this really LaGuardia come back among us again
Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben the distraught Republican Party district chieftain And Paul Lipson as Morris the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner was fine too
As for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest little man Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie who became the second Mrs. LaGuardia singing and acting with remarkable conviction Jen Nelson as Thea his first wife managed to make that short role impressive And little Zeme North a Dora with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings
Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of On The Side Of The Angels and Politics And Poker were handled splendidly and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made Little Tin Box even better than it was done by the New York cast all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity
The party at Floyd's penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era's nonsense
LaGuardia's multi-lingual rallies when he is running for Congress are well staged and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater
Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that pause long in any one place and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes glad to say none of that distraction in this Fiorello
It has all been done in superb style and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater
Loew's theater presents Where The Boys Are an MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells The cast
Since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich Brown senior while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on Where The Boys Are but I shall do nothing of the sort
Instead and not just to prove my objectivity I hasten to report that a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group that is to say sex
The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual If most of them exactly specific well the way it is in life I guess But at least reassuring to see some teenagers who profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead
Where The Boys Are also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a mermaid is performing
Most of the female faces are new or at least not too familiar Dolores Hart is charming in a leading role and quite believable I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask A couple of the males made good comedy too Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin
The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases I suppose this was the attitude the part called for I must say however that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it
To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining
The second feature The Price Of Silence is a British detective story that will talk your head off

The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment
For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James's genius not to mention the felicities of his style And how he could write His famous criticism of brother Henry's third style is surely as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latter's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor
Most of all his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead's reference to James as that adorable genius Miss Hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism
This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication or even desire for communication between differing schools of thought It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues
To his Harvard colleague Josiah Royce whose philosophic position differed radically from his own James could write Different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other social influence ever has and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly
Of another colleague George Santayana he could write The great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page
Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer Glorious old Palmer as he addresses him James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce Santayana Palmer and himself and see that their varying systems are so many religions ways of fronting life and worth fighting for then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe The best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems The world might ring with the struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other
The belaboring is of course jocular yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God To James this vision never quite came despite his appreciation of it in others
But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent You ask what I am going to reply to Bradley But why need one reply to everything and everybody I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations All polemic of ours should I believe be either very broad statements of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible impersonally As far as the rising generation goes why not simply express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other Here again God will know his own
The collected works of James Thurber now numbering 25 volumes including the present exhibit represent a high standard of literary excellence as every schoolboy knows The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall is equally well known About all that remains to be said is that the present selection most of which appeared first in The New Yorker comprises as usual a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book
The one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial article entitled How To Get Through The Day It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources including in the P's alone palindromes paraphrases and parodies
The Tyranny Of Trivia suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber And new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled Friends Romans Countrymen Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream and The New Vocabularianism Some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases
A burlesque paean entitled Hark The Herald Tribune Times And All The Other Angels Sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey How The Kooks Crumble features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-TV commercials and The Watchers Of The Night is a veritable waking nightmare
A semi-serious literary document entitled The Wings Of Henry James is noteworthy if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult later period by modest Owen Wister author of The Virginian James he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings and complexities
Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation So much has already been written about everything that you find out anything about it Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance also a quotation Woman's place is in the wrong Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences
A tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seems terribly funny though it would be hard to explain why One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed just a bat said my wife reassuringly and I sighed with relief Thank God for that I said I thought it was a human being
In a sense perhaps Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter was it Salvador Dali who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen That is it is literally a picture window you see into the viscera you see a picture trees or flowers This is something like what Thurber's best effects are like if I am not mistaken
Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches several old favorites are scattered through the present volume Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness In his concluding paragraph he writes The devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can For many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight
The latest Low is a puzzler The master's hand has lost none of its craft He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties The reader meets a few old friends like Blimp and the TUC horse and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out
But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning
Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key But this argument be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler And the leading issue that of piecemeal aggression remains the same This is drama enough
Do we ourselves offer Mr. Low less of a crusade In the thirties we would not face our enemy that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element Now we have stood up to the Communists we are stronger and more self-confident and Low so easily put us to rights
Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now He writes Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views only up to lunchtime
Whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic Dulles He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man McCarthy The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath Suez Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently so there is no fire in his eye
Stalin's death Churchill's farewell to public life Hillary and Tensing on Everest Quemoy and Matsu all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles Their Eisenhower is insubstantial Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections
He often drew the bomb He showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all But but and but
Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale Read the moderately brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas
A gray fox with a patch on one eye confidence man city slicker lebensraum specialist tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr. Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community
The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans accompanied by one wharf rat But like all despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows more threatening toward those who follow such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon Judge Black the vegetarian black snake and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces
As soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others They train the mink and other animals to fight And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he have anyone around against him and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds
Robert Hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes But hard to imagine Mr. Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables
In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus and the polished witty fables of James Thurber

George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work Scrupulous scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues
In short the book based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University is both reliable and readable the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic well the record itself is not too encouraging
Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken But he rejects perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February 1945
After all Alger Hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents was at Yalta And Harry Dexter White implicated in F.B.I. reports in Communist associations was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have simply handed Germany to Stalin One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength
It is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way
dashed hope You see first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender The tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy's power no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future
Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944 A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language history and literature Kennan recalls how at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 he penned a private note to a State Department official expressing the hope that never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries
The hope was vain With justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement about the history of its diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only he Stalin could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.D.R. himself ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged
No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of Roosevelt
This fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of World War 1 and the two instalments of the Russian Revolution The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March 1917 the second the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks who later called themselves Communists in November of the same year
As Kennan shows the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue This more than any other factor led to the fiasco of Allied intervention As the author very justly says
Had a world war not been in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the imagination have been an Allied intervention in North Russia The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda here Kennan operating with precise facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking
Plebian dictators Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected On Stalin
This was a man of incredible criminality of a criminality effectively without limits a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity a man in whose entourage none was ever safe a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime
And here is Kennan's image of Hitler Stalin's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples and his later enemy
Behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead behind the tirades and the sulky silences the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudices the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities Shrewd calculating in many ways realistic endowed like Stalin with considerable powers of dissimulation capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and resolute in his decisions and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word
Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan And in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time How to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war
But one should not ask for everything Mr. Kennan who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm In Donnybrook there is quite a different Eire a rural land where singing dancing fist-fighting and romancing are the thing There is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed By and large Robert McEnroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's film The Quiet Man provides the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one
This is the tale of one John Enright an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man But Innesfree where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother Will live is no place for a man who will not use his fists So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably thereby providing the tale which is told You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means
Then there is a matchmaker one Mikeen Flynn a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play Mr. Foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect His matchmaking is naturally incidental and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony
Art Lund a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates Enright Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have anyway Joan Fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not plays Ellen and sings the role very well too If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind she fits into the general scheme well enough
Susan Johnson as the widow spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one She has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening
Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that quite entertaining And in the role of Will Danaher Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army if he chose
Donnybrook is no Brigadoon but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing The ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally competent It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy Sez I does A Toast To The Bride sung by Clarence Nordstrom playing a character called Old Man Toomey is quite simple direct and touching
The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating
Rouben Ter-Arutunian in his stage settings often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at Donnybrook unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish
We can all breathe more easily this morning more easily and joyously too because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show Fanny into a delightful and heart-warming film
The task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed More than the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star the great Raimu were looking askance at the project The fans of the musical were too
But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show whether partial to music or not you help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart

Some of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow A tiny handful never did make the concert But after a fifteen-minute delay the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon's proceedings They faced a rather small audience as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon
It was an excellent concert Paul Paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid musician and the Philharmonic plays for him Their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding It was not a heavy ponderous Beethoven The music sang nicely sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced
The Franck symphonic poem Psyche is a lush sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again Fortunate for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor if it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying
Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score He did not let the strings for instance weep whine or get hysterical His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy
And in the Prokofieff C major Piano Concerto with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold sweeping and tonally percussive He swept through the music with ease in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner
An impressive technician Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot His tone is the weakest part of his equipment it tends to be hard and colorless A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs It is after all a non-romantic work even with the big juicy melody of the second movement and the composer himself was called the age of steel pianist But granted all this one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr. Skolovsky supplied
Taken as a whole though it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra Mr. Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received
A new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's Festival Overture receiving its first New York hearing This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry It is not program music though It runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical and featureless
La Gioconda like it or not is a singer's opera And so of course it is a fan's opera as well Snow or no the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work
So the plot creaks the sets are decaying the costumes are pre-historic the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing After all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed with no less than six leading parts
One of those parts is that of evil evil Barnaba the spy His wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo Colzani who was taking the part for the first time with the company
He has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone What was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after all a very oily character
Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect to this season they have both sung these parts here before Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik and she gave it force dramatic color and passion
Mr. Siepi was as always a consummate actor with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently Part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the vocal chords His singing was strong and musical unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality
Eileen Farrell in the title role Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and all contributed to a vigorous performance If only they and Fausto Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more
Melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could be imagined
Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces BG 609 stereo BGS 5031 is a good sample of the special elegant art of English madrigal singing It also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French chansons
The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else The original impulses came to England late in the sixteenth century and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like
Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum the practice of singing together choruses catches and glees always flourished The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way say the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal
Early interest Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England much ahead of similar revivals in other countries As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal
Naturally Mr. Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen William Byrd Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture Both techniques give the music purity and clarity
Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle the French equivalents of tarantara rum-tum-tum and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque is lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus Only with the more sensual intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial
Nevertheless the musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently reproduced make it an attractive look-see at the period The works are presented chronologically Texts and translations are provided
Elegance and color The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled and quite abstract In France it remained always more picturesque more dancelike more full of flavor
Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance
Both composers turn up on new imports from France BAM is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions De La boite A Musique They specialize in out-of-the-way items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin Le Grand occupy two disks LD056 and LD060 and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master delicate flexible and gemlike
The Concerts nos. 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense The sonatas La Francaise La Sultane and are often more elaborately worked out and in fact show a strong Italian influence
Couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise 18e Siecle BAM LD 060 Jean-Marie LeClair still is remembered a bit but Bodin De Beismortier Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo
The Couperin La Steinkerque with its battle music brevity wit and refined simplicity already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era If Couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more
All these records have close attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic
Rameau's Six Concerts En Sextuor recorded by De Chambre Pierre Menet BAM LD 046 turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself The strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious
Maitres Allemands 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel Buxtehude Rosenmueller and Telemann well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket BAM LD 035
Rococo music a lot of it was played in Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts
Works by J. C. Bach Anton Craft Joseph Haydn Giuseppe Sammartini Comenico Dragonetti and J. G. Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff flutist Josef Marx oboist and Robert Conant pianist and harpsichordist
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez
Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday night Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program but taken together they grew quite tiresome
The performances were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying some by soloists proving rather trying
Ellie Mao soprano and Frederick Fuller baritone presented a program of folksongs entitled East Meets West in Carnegie Recital Hall last night They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee pianist
Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages Songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao who is a native of China and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr. Fuller who is English by birth
This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles On the contrary Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn Dvorak Canteloube Copland and Britten There was therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise The performances were assured communicative and pleasingly informal
What was omitted from A Neglected Education were those essentials known as the facts of life
Chabrier's little one-act operetta presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall is a fragile precious little piece very French not without wit and charm The poor uneducated newlywed a certain Gontran De Boismassif has his problems in getting the necessary information The humor of the situation can be imagined
It all takes place in the eighteenth century What a silly artificial way of life Chabrier and his librettists chuckle But they wish they could bring it back
Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical rationalist tradition handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music becomes virtually neo-classicism The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish
The simple clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes Arlene Saunders was charming as poor Gontran Yes Arlene is her name the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring
The work was presented as the final event in the Town Hall Festival of Music It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera The Poor Sailor set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and gets done in by his wife
With the exception of a few spots Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration

Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon Sat there and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right before my eyes and the eyes of some 5,500 other people
I make this observation about the lady Miss Judy Garland because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day
Judy Garland has arrived in London not chubby not plump fat
But who cares when the lady sings Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet They applauded every number not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme sometimes at the first chord
And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings Things like When Smiling Almost Like Being In Love Do It Again Born To Wander Alone Together Who Cares Puttin' On The Ritz How Long Has This Been Going On And her own personal songs like The Man That Got Away and the inevitable Over The Rainbow
Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen At the start of her program there were evidences of pique She had held to the letter of her contract and come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m. the appointed hour although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 Then there was a bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs
Along about 4:30 just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side Judy came on singing in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing
In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range
There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of Do It Again and she made the tart observation that I never saw so much moving about in an audience
But it take Judy Garland showman long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music trundling microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere
And time after time she really belted out her songs Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged which was the way I felt about her Come Rain or Come Shine and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her shatteringly beautiful Beautiful Weather
To her partisan audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough
They were rewarded with splendid exciting singing Her Rockabye Your Baby was as good as it can be done and her really personal songs like The Man That Got Away were deeply moving
The audience let her leave until it had heard Over The Rainbow although the fellow that kept crying for Get Happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway She was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers
All went home happy except the Newport police who feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar
In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening flashes in the distance but no storm
Several times it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan's big band which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap
Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations
But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement of Django's Castle
For subtle swinging rhythms I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of Weep and the fireworks went on display in 18 Carrots For Robert a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges
There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group Unfortunately Blakey choose to work much of the time in this vein He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like
What we did get however was impressive
A few drops of rain just before midnight when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand most of the listeners care whether they got wet
Miss Vaughan was back in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time like a fine wine After the spate of female vocalists we have been having all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever
Jazz Three open program The evening program was opened by the Jazz Three a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass Jack Warner drums and Don Cook piano This was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group also local talent went on first
Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience
The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns & Leon James the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program
Julie Wilson sings Julie Wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as Hard-Hearted Hannah The Vamp Of Savannah and the delightful Sunday She frosted the cake with the always reliable Bill Bailey
From this taste of the 1920s we leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz which did lovely subtle things for Baubles Bangles And Beads and a couple of ballards
Getz is a difficult musician to categorize He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over In this he is sticking with tradition however far removed from it he may seem to be
Shearing takes over George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of vibes guitar bass drums Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer He met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo Shearing himself seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances
A very casual pleasant program one of those easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach
Divided almost equally into two parts it consisted of The Evolution Of The Blues narrated by Jon Hendricks who had presented it last year at the Monterey Calif. Jazz Festival and an hour-long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band
Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches
Surprise addition To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had Big Miller as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean Gospel-singer while Oscar Brown Jr. an extremely talented young man did a slave auctioneer's call a field-hands' work song and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby Brown Baby which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival
One of those delightful surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones drumming to Old Man River which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts
Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year's afternoon concerts
Hendricks had Billy Mitchell tenor sax Pony Poindexter alto sax Jimmy Witherspoon Blues singer and a good one and the Ike Isaacs Trio which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical examples
It all went very well
Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas Music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example played for RCA by Emil Gilels He has chosen Sonata Op. 53 in Aj The playing takes both sides of the disc Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length Rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention with the Gilels playing His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully
The male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style The group is superbly trained What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question Do you say chantey as if the word were derived from the French word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the French-Canadian use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard I say chantey Either way the Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening If your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one
The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini a baritone whose fame is international

Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work Signal and the repetition of an earlier one Journal
Signal is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg Program note reads as follows
Take hands this urgent visage beckons us
Here as in Journal Mr. Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements Indeed both Journal and Signal qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development
It may be of course that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation But it may be also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time One thing is certain however and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be
an American journey A brisk satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled An American Journey was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time as well as her Women's Song and Mr. Nagrin's Indeterminate Figure
Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for An American Journey and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes
Mr. Nagrin has described four places each with its scenery and people added two diversions and concluded with A Toccata for the Young a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing
The places could be anywhere the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody's and the laugh is on us all But we need not mind too much because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way
Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures that bother them somehow
Unfortunately the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time The music here Russell Smith's Tetrameron sounded good
All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company with Mr. Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers seemed to be fine shape
The Symphony Of The Air greatly assisted by Van Cliburn last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start At the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each of them in five different communities
This news announced by Jerome Toobin the orchestra's administrative director brought applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony
This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains The details of the suburban concerts next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced later Mr. Toobin said
The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky the Rachmaninoff Third and the Prokofieff Third It was pleasant last night therefore to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded The Emperor
The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him But they were not what distinguished his performance The elements that did were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo
Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne Alfred Wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding poetic mystery The collaboration was remarkable as it was in both the other movements too
Mr. Wallenstein who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the Leonore Overture No. 3 and the Fourth Symphony The orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven Igor Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb. 4
There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in Today in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it
In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' The Man I Love Deemed too static when it was first heard in Lady Be Good in Philadelphia in 1924 it was dropped from the score It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of Strike Up The Band and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up It finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of Strike Up The Band in 1929 Still another song in Strike Up The Band Got A Crush On You was retrieved from a 1928 failure Treasure Girl
second chance Like the Gershwins Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them If one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show
Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing album Rodgers And Hart Revisited Spruce Records 505 Fifth Avenue New York
Among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of The Garrick Gaieties an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed Dorothy Loudon's raucous listing of the attractions At The Roxy Music Hall from I Married An Angel and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of I Blush a song that was cut from A Connecticut Yankee
Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment
Turning to the current musical season on Broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying has been transferred to an original cast album R. C. A. Victor LOC 1066 stereo LSO 1066 that has some entertaining moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect Robert Morse singing with comically plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score
Rudy Vallee who shares star billing with Mr. Morse makes only two appearances He shares with Mr. Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia Martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice In general Mr. Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer
Like Mr. Loesser Jerry Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk And Honey R. C. A. Victor LOC 1065 stereo LSO 1065 but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics For this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles
Resourceful voices There are the full-bodied resourceful voices of Robert Weede Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr. Herman's lilting melodies and for an occasional change of pace the bright humor of Molly Picon Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms
Not content to create only the music and lyrics Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away Capitol WAO 1643 stereo SWAO 1643 a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward's more memorable works The melodies flow along pleasantly as Mr. Coward's songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality Elaine Stritch who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr. Coward's songs
With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 The House I Live In The Cranes Are Flying and Ballad Of A Soldier we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in The Day The War Ended It simply not by a long shot The Artkino presentation with English titles opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre
Make no mistake this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import aptly grave carefully written performed and directed In describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle-sized German city the picture has color pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments Told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple at both sides of the conflict's aftermath
Unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this romance at the expense of everything else Tenderly and rather tediously the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they want to hurt the old story war or no war and more than one viewer may recall Hollywood's Titanic several seasons back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante
Not that the picture is superficial Under Yakov Segal's direction it begins stirringly as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first surrender gesture One high-up camera shot is magnificent as the Germans straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square and drop their weapons

Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell 211 pages Dutton A5
Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell is just that a haunting warmly personal chronicle of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands
He has married me with a ring of bright water begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys The place is Camusfearna the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye It is a land of long fjords few people a single-lane road miles away and of wild stags Greylag geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift the subtle changes in season over ten years is a moving experience Just the evocations of time and place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost would be enough
But it There is Mijbil an otter who travelled with Maxwell and gave Maxwell's name to a new species from the Tigris marshes to his London flat It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature This is not only a compliment to Mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London then by train where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap to Camusfearna with affectionate detail
Mij as his owner was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow Systematically he would open and ransack drawers Given a small ball or marbles he would invent games and play by himself for hours With curiosity and elan he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell who nearly lost his life in doing so
A year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted but self-discovery as well In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness To be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses
Now with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need that of being trusted implicitly by some creature Two other people in time shared Mijbil's love it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water we were his Trinity and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation In turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his worship
Yet the idyll ended The brief details of Mijbil's death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy Man to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man But then through a strange coincidence Maxwell manages to acquire Idal a female otter and the fascinating story starts once more
One is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book Mijbil with his rollicking ways or Maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid and unabashed This reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement Now Gavin Maxwell's Ring Of Bright Water has widened to enchant the world New York The performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater
They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century On the contrary the old plays are continually being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie
Of course the well-received revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who in two instances this season closed their plays after one performance But they are aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic
In France novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted The government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results
So far as I know the Comedie has never put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century but they do reinterpret plays and characters Last season the Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's Phedre and Moliere's School For Wives
The new Phedre was done in 17th century setting instead of ancient Greek perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent
The new School For Wives was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character
Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while Fernand Ledoux often performing at the Comedie made them more gross than Moliere may have intended
Apparently Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in The School For Wives I say apparently although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death by that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy
Arnolphe it will be recalled is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be The part can lend itself to serious treatment one influential French critic remarked Pity for Arnolphe comes with age
Accordingly at the Comedie last year Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly
Wisely the Comedie has brought Moliere's Tartuffe on its tour and has left The School For Wives at home Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor's wife Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot and Ledoux at the Comedie made him a gross buffoon or so the historians tell us
Louis Seigner who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux is the Tartuffe of the present production which he himself directed His Tartuffe observes the golden mean His red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory of course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation
Occasionally Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another The whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts His normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly Here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of meanness and slyness
Seigner is the dean of the company the oldest actor in point of continuous service In that function he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie We are often told that the Comedie has unfortunately life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage Seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company among his other parts are the leads in The Bourgeois Gentleman and The Imaginary Invalid
In Moliere's farce The Tricks Of Scapin Robert Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles Here some innovation is attempted
To begin with Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master Hirsch's Scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves
Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's servant
Django Reinhardt the ill-fated gypsy was a true artist one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels
There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who owe something to Django And Django owed much to Louis Armstrong He told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea Market in Paris It was the first jazz he had heard
Django who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France was an extraordinary man Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette And this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz
You can catch up with him if you already on RCA-Victor's album Djangology made up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France This is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too of course He is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin
They play Minor Swing Honeysuckle Rose Beyond The Sea Bricktop Heavy Artillery Djangology After Gone Where Are You My Love I Saw Stars Lover Man Menilmontant and Swing 42
All this is great proceedings get the minutes
Kid Ory the trombonist chicken farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz He dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember
Good Time Jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made He is starred against Alvin Alcorn trumpet Phil Gomez clarinet Cedric Haywood piano Julian Davidson guitar Wellman Braud bass and Minor Hall drums
The set contains High Society Do What Ory Say Down Home Rag Careless Love Jazz Me Blues Weary Blues Original Dixieland One-Step Bourbon Street Parade Panama Toot Toot Tootsie Oh He Ramble Beale Street Blues Maryland My Maryland 1919 Rag Eh La Bas Mood Indigo and Bugle Call Rag
All this will serve to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems

Mischa Elman shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers
His portion of the program and a big portion it was consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin to wit the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man Mr. Elman is 70 years old
There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman But with all due respects and allowances it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet more mannered than musical The occasion was sentimental so was the playing
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston's Dance Overture William Schuman's Chester From New England Triptych and two works of Wallingford Riegger Dance Rhythms Op. 58 and a Romanza For Strings Op. 56A
The Creston is purely a potboiler with Spanish English French and American dances mixed into the stew The Riegger with its Latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale like his sweet attractive Romanza it belongs to what the composer called his Non-Dissonant Mostly category of works The Schuman Chester takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect
All these potboilers or no provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors It was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change We have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony
A woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of A Question Of Adultery yesterday's new British import at the Apollo
Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise the film's extensive discussion of the problem seems at best superfluous In its present artless low-budget form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath
With Julie London enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive The explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident
Anthony Steel as the husband is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action adulterous The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander
After a protracted hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility the jury to no one's surprise leaves the legal question unresolved When the husband drops the case and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place So was the audience London July 4 For its final change of bill in its London season the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased
And please it did in every sense of the word for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences At the end of the program indeed there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes and nothing could stop it Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number Taras Bulba but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all Only a plea from the house manager John Collins finally broke up the party
But for all the manifest intention to show off this was a circus with a difference for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company
The Taras Bulba excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev-Sedoi It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women and it contains everything in the books lusty comedy gregarious cavorting and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform Yuri Soloviev Oleg Sokolov Alexei Zhitkov Lev Sokolov Yuri Korneyev and Mr. Livshitz were the chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent
At the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus ballet Bayaderka which opened the evening What a man this Petipa was And why do we in the West know so few of his ballets This scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human which of course is altogether fitting The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness and adagio is the general medium of the piece
Its ballerina Olga Moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and Ludmilla Alexeyeva Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments Sergei Vikulov as the lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the work is designed to belong to the ladies
The middle section of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal merit but all of them pretty good at that They consisted of a new arrangement of Nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by Irina Kolpakova and Mr. Sokolev with a large ensemble a winning little Snow Maiden variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils and superb esthetic acrobacy by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other an amusing character pas de cinq called Gossiping Women a stirring Flames Of Paris pas de deux by Xenia Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky and a lovely version of Fokine's Le Cygne by Olga Moiseyeva which had to be repeated
Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor
It was quite an evening
A year ago today when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency Theodore H. White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960
As the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated Mr. White took more notes He traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard M. Nixon
He asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates' in-groups He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history
Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr. White in The Making Of The President 1960
This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history Mr. White who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter His zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book
A lesson in politics As a dramatic narrative The Making Of The President 1960 is continuously engrossing And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational
The author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr. Kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls five Democrats Senator Hubert H. Humphrey Senator Stuart Symington Senator Lyndon B. Johnson Adlai E. Stevenson and Mr. Kennedy and two Republicans Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon
Then in chronological order Mr. White covers the primary campaigns the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself In the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race religion local tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television Mr. White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself but never from Mr. Nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust
Rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less says Mr. White Mr. Nixon he believes has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign Although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man Mr. Nixon Mr. White believes ignored his own top-level planners wasted time and effort in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television
Mr. Nixon is a broody moody man given to long stretches of introspection he trusts only himself and his wife He is a man of major talent but a man of solitary uncertain impulses He was above all a friend seeker almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M. Landon
Mr. Kennedy Mr. White believes had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him Calm dignified composed superbly eloquent Mr. Kennedy always knew everything about everybody He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance Mr. Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy to be a fine President
Pressures portrayed Throughout The Making Of A President Mr. White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play key roles And he makes many interesting comments Here are several
The root question in American politics is always the Man to See To understand American politics is simply to know people to know the relative weight of names who are heroes who are straw men who controls who does not But to operate in American politics one must go a step further one must build a bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection
In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion
All platforms are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it
Nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts
Miss Pons is certainly not 70 no singer ever is and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments The better part of gallantry might be perhaps to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing
No orchestra however could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night In all fairness there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate vocalism
One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's Shadow Song The years suddenly fell away at this point On the whole however one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on
Sharing the program was the young French-Canadian tenor Richard Verreau making his stadium debut on this occasion Mr. Verreau began shakily with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume Later on this problem vanished and the Flower Song from Bizet's Carmen was beautifully and intelligently projected

Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible
The mushrooming of FM outlets offering concerts both jazz and classical lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity
Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners an audience which in the United States comprises some 19,000,000 people with $20,000,000,000 to spend each year
Of course the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials
But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects It is estimated that more than 600 stations of a total of 3,400 do a significant amount of programing for the Negro At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states
These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine a trade publication for radio and TV advertisers For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio
In the past 10 years Sponsor observes these trends have become apparent Negro population in the U.S. has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent The forgotten 15 million as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey has become a better-remembered 19 million
Advertisers are changing their attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it
Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational economic and cultural levels Futhermore the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects not simply serve on the air
In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent according to a research man quoted by Sponsor
A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business
The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth It also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the U.S. Negroes live outside the southeastern states Also the state with the largest number of Negroes is New York not in the South at all
In New York City WLIB boasts more community service programs than any other Negro station and one of the largest Negro news staffs in America And WWRL's colorful mobile unit cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests Recently WWRL won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit A half-dozen other stations in the New York area also bid for attention of the city's Negro population up about 50 per cent in the past decade
In all big cities outside the South and even in small towns within the South radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners The Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total U.S. Negro population
One question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving into a fully integrated status
Whatever the long-range impact of integration the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only from a fact sheet
What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers rhythm-and-blues mood music race music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs Furthermore news and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station Advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro concern
Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous
The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of J. Walter Carroll of KSAN San Francisco
Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements and desires It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation
Presentation of The Life And Times Of John Sloan in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art
Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow Helen Farr Sloan to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's work From early family portraits painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year 1951 and still part of his estate
Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness The paintings drawings prints and illustrations all reflect the manners costumes and mores of America in the first half of the present century
Obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri As early as 1928 however the Sloan style began to change The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes
The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many-sided art In addition to the paintings are drawings prints and illustrations Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs
One of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is Sun And Wind On The Roof with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds Although there are landscapes in the show one of the strongest is a vista of Gloucester Harbor in 1915 the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan's art
Significant are such canvases as Bleeker Street Saturday Night with its typically American crowd Sloan never went abroad the multifigure Traveling Carnival in which action is vivified by lighting or Carmine Theater 1912 the only canvas with an ash can and foraging dog although Sloan was a member of the famous Eight and of the so-called Ash-Can School a term he resented
Not all the paintings however are of cities The exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest Koshare in the Dust a vigorous Indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette
The fact that Sloan was an extrovert concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle
There are 151 items in the Wilmington show including one painting by each member of the Eight as well as work by Sloan's friends and students Supplementing the actual art are memorabilia correspondence diaries books from the artist's library etc. All belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs. Sloan who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League New York in the 1920's
To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries the Delaware Art Center according to its director Bruce St. John will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works as well as a card index file The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians
The current exhibition which remains on view through Oct. 29 has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources
Any musician playing Beethoven here where Beethoven was born is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care In a sense he is offering Bonn what its famous son who left as a youth never did the sound of the composer's mature style
Robert Riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the style His readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative without being presumptuous The 32 C Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline
The D Minor Sonata Op. 31 No. 2 introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of opera style of which Beethoven was genuinely capable but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging
Two late Sonatas Op. 110 and 111 were played with similar insight the disarming simplicities of the Op. 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles of Op. 126 Herr Riefling in everything he gave his large Beethoven Hall audience proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority
Volker Wangenheim who conducted Bonn's Stadtisches Orchester on the following evening made one more conscious of the process of interpretation Herr Wangenheim has only recently become the city's music director and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium
But he weighted the Eighth Symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music He might have been hoping to all appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program could amount to something like the Ninth but no amount of head-tossing could make it so
The conductor's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed it did so with plenty of spring
The concerto's soloist Hans Richter-Haaser played with compensatory ease and economy though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling His was a burgomaster's Beethoven solid and sensible
Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano Chorus And Orchestra In C Minor made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs The entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein Bonn's civic chorus was worth all the waiting however as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life
The last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis

A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise This theory eventually proved inexact But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science
It is the business of cosmologists the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors These keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge
In the autumn of 1959 the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator The participants were Professor H. Bondi professor of mathematics at King's College London Dr. W. B. Bonnor reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College London Dr. R. A. Lyttleton a lecturer at St. John's College Cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge and Dr. G. J. Whitrow reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology London
Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called Rival Theories Of Cosmology
Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on the general theory of relativity First of all and this has been calculated by observation the universe is expanding that is the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds Because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there This expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years
Expands and contracts Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in Then after many more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again
Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space For this reason he says the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies
If this is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe is expanding For new galaxies to be created Professor Bondi declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years He contends this idea conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments
Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons Protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen the basic building block of matter The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but Dr. Lyttleton is not so sure Suppose says Dr. Lyttleton the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron so slight it is presently immeasurable This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess
Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere Because electrical forces the charge-excess are far more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere
Dr. Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it This he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe
Fleeting glimpse This slim book while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field
It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science Presently the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories
There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions
In doing away with the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos And although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man Roots the new play at the brand-new Mayfair Theater on 46th St. which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York most of Roots is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy
Only in its final scene where Beatie Bryant Mary Doyle shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts
The burden of Mr. Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil at least in England are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine Rather they are genuine clods proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought They care no more for politics says Mr. Wesker than they do for a symphony Seeming to have roots in the soil they actually have none in life They dwell in short in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived
But this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it So much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer unless he has been living in a gilded palace perhaps and wants a real big heap of contrast The messy meals the washing of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such a thing as redundancy
Now for the good points Miss Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a warm smile She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie we never do see him and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating including a dose of good British socialism But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal
Beatie getting no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by Roots
There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including William Hansen's impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic father and Katherine Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter or anyone else But I am afraid Mr. Wesker's meat and potatoes dish well seasoned enough for local audiences
Shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's Much Ado About Nothing opening the season of free theatre in Central Park
The New York Shakespeare Festival which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed began bravely Joseph Papp impassioned founder of the festival and director of Much Ado had a vibrant colorful production under way Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture
The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised chuckles The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads evoked laughter The vivacity of the masquers' party at Leonato's palace with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon cast a spell of delight
As Much Ado turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall At first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas were opened But the rain came more heavily and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart The grieving Hero and her father Leonato followed by the Friar left the stage A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes
More than half the audience departed Some remained in the Wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads Others huddled under the trees outside the fence Twenty minutes after the interruption although it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped
Beatrice Nan Martin and Benedick J. D. Cannon took their places on the stage In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare like a Nostradamus had foreseen this moment
Said Benedick Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while
Replied Beatrice Yea and I will weep a while longer
The heavens refused to give up their weeping The gallant company completed Act 4 and got through part of Act 5 But the final scenes could not be played If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort Much Ado ends happily
The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare One could hardly blame Newbold Morris the Parks Commissioner for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains
Eldon Elder who designed the stage also created a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable

Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints Still a demurrer or two must be entered
Schwarzkopf is of course Schwarzkopf For style and assurance for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful instrument controlled and flexible Put to the service of lieder of Schubert Brahms Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way it made its effect with ease and precision
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism Instead of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical expression Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable Clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little too melodramatic There was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in the interest of effect The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness
There were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist John Wustman often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them
The dance dancers and dance enthusiasts 8,500 of them had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs
On Saturday the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved
There was additionally a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey's Roots Of The Blues a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival
Otherwise the program included as on Thursday the Taras-Tchaikovsky Design For Strings the Dollar-Britten Divertimento the Dollar-De Banfield The Duel and the pas de deux from The Nutcracker
Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn who danced the Nutcracker pas de deux were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from Don Quixote another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely
Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in The Duel a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants
Mr. Ailey's Roots Of The Blues an earthy and very human modern dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening
As Brother John Sellers sang five blues to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and ecstatic
Their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm fan He wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress
The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes almost frightening tensions Roots Of The Blues may not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its super-charged impact
Perhaps it is better to stay at home The armchair traveler preserves his illusions This somewhat cynical comment may be found in Blue Skies Brown Studies a collection of travel essays by William Sansom who would never consider staying home for long Mr. Sansom is English bearded formidably cultivated the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between
The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty her third and an American multimillionaire his fourth The result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices
There are sixteen essays in Blue Skies Brown Studies Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines All are well written and are overwritten But even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can charm and astound Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another Mr. Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English with a thick shower of sophisticated cultural references
A contemplative connoisseur I like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells and looks like its color its particular kind of life This is an exact description of what Mr. Sansom does He ignores guidebook facts He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past
William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London Vienna the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions A writer lives at best in a state of astonishment he says Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all To transmit that feeling he writes This may not be true of many writers but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants La Bonne Auberge which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport and at the infinite variety of London
Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls to those who recall easily the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto He can coin a neat phrase a street spattered with an invigoration of people tulips with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears after a snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity And for all his lacquered almost Byzantine self-consciousness he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison
Beauty borrowed from afar In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus
The white colonnaded cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips Nice even if a trifle gaudy
Blue Skies Brown Studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs
In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio WBAI the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void Yesterday it offered Poised For Violence by Jean Reavey
WBAI is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate Unfortunately Poised For Violence was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point
Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall and in addition employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged
The play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty
Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt Moreover her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills
But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words Which in itself is an immediate reward of the WBAI experiment good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration
A weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month
Titled New In Music The enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station Aj
The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze The show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor Chuck Briefer
The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings Last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch Karlheinz Stockhausen Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new space opera by the Swedish composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl
Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer a particular type of music or the music of a given country
It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene But one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions
The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close
It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart
It is good to see those numbers again The Suite Of Old Russian Dances that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth the amusing Yurochka in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance the lovely and of course vigorous Polyanka or The Meadow the three Moldavian dances entitled Zhok the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called Bul'ba and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called City Quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been and they are welcome back
So for that matter are the newer dances the Kalmuk Dance with its animal movements that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called The Platter the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called Summer The Three Shepherds of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs and of course the trenchant Rock 'n' Roll

As autumn starts its annual sweep few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth The only other regions so blessed are the British Isles western Europe eastern China southern Chile and parts of Japan New Zealand and Tasmania Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson gold purple bronze blue and vermilion that flame up in North America Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle in fact a freezing autumn dulls the blaze The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain followed by sunny days and cool nights Foliage pilgrimages either organized or individual are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year Below is a specific guide keyed to the calendar
Nature Canada
Late September finds Quebec's color at its peak especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St. Lawrence River In the Maritime provinces farther east the tones are a little quieter Ontario's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10 with both Muskoka 100 miles north of Toronto and Haliburton 125 miles northwest of Toronto holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23 In the Canadian Rockies great groves of aspen are already glinting gold New England
Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15 and often hit a height in early October New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October
Middle Atlantic states
The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October choice routes being 9N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color over the Catskills in mid-October notably along routes 23 and 23A About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania are magnificent Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival on Oct. 14 15 New Jersey's color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May Southeast
During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia The most brilliant displays are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee Midwest
Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of September well into October especially in their northern sections e.g. Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama celebration is Sept. 29-Oct. 8 In Wisconsin take route 55 north of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie Du Chien In Michigan there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula are spectacular In Minnesota Arrowhead County and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding Farther south there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks with some seasonal peaks as late as early November Illinois' Shawnee National Forest Missouri's Iron County and the maples of Hiawatha Kan. should be at their best in mid-October The West
The Rockies have many Aspencades which are organized tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage points for viewing the golden panoramas In Colorado Ouray has its Fall Color Week Sept. 22-29 Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept. 24 and Steamboat Springs has a week-long Aspencade Sept. 25-30 New Mexico's biggest is at Ruidoso Oct. 7 8 while Alamogordo and Cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips Oct. 1
Americana pleasure domes
Two sharply contrasting places designed for public enjoyment are now on display
The Corn Palace at Mitchell S. Dak. the world's corniest building has a carnival through Sept. 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt Since 1892 ears of red yellow purple and white corn have annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create huge paintings The 1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial Centennial with the pictures including the Lewis and Clark expedition the first river steamboat the 1876 gold rush a little red schoolhouse on the prairie and today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs The panels will stay up until they are replaced next summer
Longwood Gardens near Kennett Square Pa. about 12 miles from Wilmington Del. was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre S. Du Pont Every Wednesday night through Oct. 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display with 229 nozzles throwing jets of water up to 130 feet The peacock tail nozzle throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high The gardens themselves are open free of charge the year round and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out by any visitor The greenhouses alone cover 3-1/2 acres
Books clock without hands
Carson McCullers after a long painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul has come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication Though the subject segregation in her native South has been thoroughly worked Miss McCullers uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern American writing Franny and Zooey
With an art that almost conceals art J. D. Salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts Here in the most eagerly awaited novel of the season his first since The Catcher In The Rye he tells of a college girl in flight from the life around her and the tart but sympathetic help she gets from her 25-year-old brother The Head Of Monsieur M. Althea Urn A deft hilarious satire on very high French society involving a statesman with two enviable possessions a lovely young bride and a head containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove it for greater comfort There is probably a moral in all this about mind vs. heart A Matter Of Life And Death
Virgilia Peterson a critic by trade has turned her critical eye pitilessly and honestly on herself in an autobiography more of the mind and heart than of specific events It is an engrossing commentary on a repressive upper-middle-class New York way of life in the first part of this century Dark Rider
This retelling by Louis Zara of the brief anguished life of Stephen Crane poet and master novelist at 23 dead at 28 is in novelized form but does not abuse its tragic subject Rural Free Rachel Peden Subtitled A Farmwife's Almanac Of Country Living this is a gentle and nostalgic chronicle of the changing seasons seen through the clear humorous eye of a Hoosier housewife and popular columnist

Movies Purple Noon This French film set in Italy is a summertime splurge in shock and terror all shot in lovely sunny scenery so breath-taking that at times you almost forget the horrors the movie is dealing with But slowly they take over as Alain Delon Life Sept. 15 playing a sometimes appealing but always criminal boy casually tells a rich and foot-loose American that he is going to murder him then does it even while the American is trying to puzzle out how Delon expects to profit from the act

More and more boats move overland on wheels 1.8 million trailers are now in use and Midwesterners taking long weekends can travel south with their craft In the Southwest the fall brings out flotillas of boatsmen who find the summer too hot for comfort And on northern shores indomitable sailors from Long Island to Lake Michigan will beat around the buoys in dozens of frostbite races Some pleasant fall cruising country is mapped out below
Boating west coast
Pleasure boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp breezes bring out craft of every size on every kind of water ocean lake and reservoir Shore facilities are enormous Los Angeles harbors 5,000 boats and Long Beach 3,000 but marinas are crowded everywhere New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa Del Rey Ventura Dana Point Oceanside and Mission Bay

A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 If this was in fact Mr. Remarque's intention he has achieved a notable failure Clerfayt of Heaven Has No Favorites resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver quite a bad race-driver whereas Portago was a good one He is a dull unformed and aimless person the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent purposeful and passionate
One looked forward to Mr. Remarque's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised Unhappily Heaven Has No Favorites does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list
Mr. Remarque's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery His treatment of it is something else His heroine chooses to die the price of recovery years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium being higher than she wishes to pay Her lover precedes her in death at the wheel and presumably he too has chosen Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse some demure and rather fetching love-making pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe and a modicum of automobile racing The ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing the love-making perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is often charming the automobile racing bears little relation to reality
This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as say a tournament golfer Hazards to life and limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant Race-drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes He does not The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal The book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing The necessity is not clear to me and in any case to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car which or whom he calls Giuseppe parked on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around him is not a liberty it is an absurdity
But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of the book that Remarque's failure is plainest Clerfayt is neurotic preoccupied and passive To be human he believes is to seek one's own destruction the Freudian death-wish cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers In point of fact the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live A Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit a Portago could say as he did say to me If I die tomorrow still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years but I die tomorrow live to be 105
Clerfayt transported may think of the engine driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood The Italian master Piero Taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae Clerfayt driving sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell the Briton Stirling Moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all time believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet
Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us
However my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists
The west is leaderless according to this book In contrast the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev Tito and Mao Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all
It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy
But these Western countries do care about themselves Each feels intensely national If say the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub then Tom Jones would fight the Commies But he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it such as cause For all practical purposes the West stands disunited undedicated and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership
With this barrage Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West Never given to mincing words he places heavy blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state With Britain looking inward overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States
Montgomery believes that she started well America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace America has divided more than she has united the West The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked However she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed
But the greater reason for fumbling stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor They are determined Montgomery writes not to be surprised again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible
The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad To Monty the American people who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War
As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead The path to leadership is made clear Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own house in order Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany that the East German government does not exist that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired that the true government of China is in Formosa that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960 and that either China or Russia wants or expects war
Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically and establish that true unity about which it has always talked After drastically overhauling NATO Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West Major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by 1970 The West should make the central proposal but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out
But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle He alone has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach a decision But De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul
Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency and be honest and morally proper All in all Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him
In looking as far back as Moses thence to Cromwell Napoleon Lincoln Churchill and Nehru Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war
However Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice Most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene Like Eisenhower he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians However at the same time Montgomery selects as his hero De Gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions Monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support For the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts
Nevertheless Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events
It is no common thing for a listener critical or otherwise to hear a singer live for the first time only after he has died But then Mario Lanza was no common singer and his whole career public and non-public was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital only when he has ceased to be a living voice It is a kind of justice too that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate RCA Victor LM 2454 $4.98
To be sure Lanza made numerous concert tours here and abroad but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk

The reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving public the horse-playing public all these and others fill substantial roles in U.S. life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating public The Department of Agriculture averaged out U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs. per person which allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day That mother hen of the weight-height tables the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight
Through previous centuries eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just getting enough Now big forces buffet food For the first time in history the U.S. has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce In this same society the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume Refrigeration automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health To eat is human the nation is learning to think to survive divine
Fads facts Not all the concern for health is well directed From the fusty panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the U.S. has progressed to curds concentrates and capsules Each year reports the American Medical Association ten million Americans spend $900 million on vitamins tonics and other food supplements At juice bars in Los Angeles' 35 health stores a new sensation is a pink high-protein cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherry-flavored No-Cal which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz. glass Grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all
But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health and a big group of U.S. scientists wants to supply them The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys 57 inventor of the wartime K for Keys ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well From his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene under the university's football stadium in Minneapolis We get a rumble on every touchdown blocky grey-haired Dr. Keys directs an ambitious $200,000-a-year experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing Pursuing it he has logged 500,000 miles suffered indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini He has measured the skinfolds the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades of Neapolitan firemen studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters analyzed the mealie-meal eaten by Capetown coloreds and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen
And fats
Keys's findings though far from complete are likely to smash many an eating cliche Vitamins eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on though mothers' milk is still the ticket Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack Already many an American knows his count and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 safe or 250 dangerous
Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far
Americans eat too much The typical U.S. daily menu says Dr. Keys contains 3,000 calories should contain 2,300 And extra weight increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack
Americans eat too much fat With meat milk butter and ice cream the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40% fat and most of that is saturated fat the insidious kind says Dr. Keys that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary disease
Obesity a malnutrition
Throughout much of the world food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life The deficiency diseases scurvy tropical sprue pellagra run rampant In West Africa for example where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals a childhood menace is kwashiorkor or Red Johnny a growth-stunting protein deficiency signs reddish hair bloated belly that kills more than half its victims leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease
In the well-fed U.S. deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years Today as Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine a standard internist's text puts it The most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity
Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin Says Keys Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral the fat man would start to think Morals aside the fat man has plenty to worry about over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him The simple mechanical strain of overweight says New York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe can overburden and damage the heart for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums He has for unclear reasons a 25% higher death rate from cancer He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes He may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement
Physiologically people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the appestat is set too high The appestat which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant is located says Jolliffe in the hypothalamus near the body's temperature sleep and water-balance controls Physical exercise raises the appestat So does cold weather In moderate doses alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite the original reason for the cocktail but because liquor has a high caloric value 100 calories per oz. the heavy drinker is seldom hungry In rare cases diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroying nearly all sense of satiety
Food for frustration
Far more frequently overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion It may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity or in children simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging Some families place undue emphasis on food conversations center on it and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment The result says Jolliffe The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life Food may act as a sedative giving temporary emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does Reports Dr. Keys A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more He may be interested in another woman or just like being with the boys So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake a matter of boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something because being deprived of something else
For the army of compulsive eaters from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines Benzedrine Dexedrine as dangerous crutches for a weak will
Keys has no such objections to Metrecal Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters Metrecal is a pretty complete food he says It contains large amounts of protein vitamins and minerals In the quantity of 900 calories a day anyone will lose weight on it 20 30 or 40 lbs. But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food
That remarkable cholesterol
Despite his personal distaste for obesity disgusting Dr. Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No. 1 killer coronary artery disease which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year twice the toll from all varieties of cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents
Cholesterol the cornerstone of Dr. Keys's theory is a mysterious yellowish waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol Scientists assume that cholesterol from the Greek chole meaning bile and sterios meaning solid is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total solid weight They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system But they fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver Although the fatty protein molecules carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble cholesterol itself is insoluble and be destroyed by the body A remarkable substance says Dr. Keys quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries
When thus deposited Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks Explains Keys As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery The proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left behind As cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation Eventually says Keys one of two things happens A clot forms at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack Or more commonly thinks Keys the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured
Fats & coronaries
Ordinarily the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs for transportation of fats and for production of bile Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods eaten in normal amounts says Dr. Keys do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood But fatty foods do
During World War 2 doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact despite the stresses of Nazi occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping Not until long after the war 1950 in fact did they get a hint of the reason That year Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods That same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to rise Here Keys and others such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats and even between different varieties of each
All natural food fats fall into one of three categories saturated mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated The degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens Mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens
The three fats have similar caloric values about 265 calories per oz. but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol
