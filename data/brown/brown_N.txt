Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner He was well rid of her He certainly want a wife who was fickle as Ann If he had married her have been asking for trouble
But all of this was rationalization Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann and then could not get back to sleep His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country but there was a stubborn streak in him that allow it
The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work He found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann each day the hurt was a little duller a little less poignant
He had plenty of work to do Because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years The grass in the meadows came fast now that the warm weather was here He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows
He had no idea how much time Budd would give him In any case he had no intention of being caught asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm
When in late afternoon on the last day in June he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up No one walked in this country least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew Morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever
He cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his Winchester and started downstream His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet
Reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his Winchester in his hands They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty They were dirty their clothes were torn and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door She lay there making no effort to get back on her feet The boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring
Morgan hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one He think it was possible for this couple to be pretending The boy licked his dry lips He asked Could we have a drink
Morgan jerked his head toward the front door In the kitchen he said Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl Get up water in the house
She move or say anything Her eyes were glazed as if she hear or even see him She had reached a point at which she even care how she looked Her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new skin under it red and angry
Her blond hair was frowzy her dress torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection It must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding
He picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house She was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms that he even sure she was conscious Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him Besides she had a sweet face that attracted him
He put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table They looked a good deal alike Morgan thought Both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity of features
Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girl's head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth She drank greedily and murmured Thank you as he lowered her head
He stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced her to this condition He had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two
The girl dropped off to sleep Morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy
Who are you and what happened to you He asked
Billy Jones the boy answered my wife Sharon We ran out of money and we eaten for two days
What are you doing here
Are we in Wyoming
Morgan nodded About five miles north of the line
Jones sighed as if relieved been looking for work but all the ranchers have turned us down
You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work Morgan demanded The town of only about six miles from here Why you go there
We want town work Jones said
This is a mighty empty country Morgan said only one more ranch three miles north of here have starved to death if missed both places
Then lucky we got here Could you give us a job Mr.
Morgan Dan Morgan
He was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but he knew nothing about the couple They might kill him in his sleep thinking there was money in the house He dismissed the possibility at once The girl's thin face haunted him It the face of a killer He so sure about the boy He shaved for several weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression
There was more to this than Jones had told him They were running from something be an idiot to let them stay he thought but he send them on either
I could use some help Morgan said finally but I afford to pay you anything I guess better go on in the morning
work for our keep the boy said eagerly been mucking in a mine in the San Juan but I used to work on a ranch Sharon cooked in a restaurant work hard Mr. Morgan
see Morgan said Right now you need a meal and a bath Your in terrible shape
I know Jones said dejectedly
Morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table When the meal was ready he told Jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl He said got some supper ready
She rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed Who are you How did we get here
Dan Morgan This is the Rafter Aj You fell down in front of the house and I carried you in I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep
Oh She stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said then she murmured very kind Mr. Morgan Do you take in all the strays who come by
I have many strays coming to my front door he said Think you can walk to the table
Of course
She got to her feet staggered and almost fell He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen She sat down at the table shaking her head sorry Mr. Morgan usually a very strong woman but awfully tired
And hungry he said Start in not much of a meal but what I eat
Not much of a meal The girl cried Mr. Morgan the best-looking food I ever saw
He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much When they were finally satisfied Jones said I think going to give us work
The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself When he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he send them on She said I guess the Lord looks out for fools drunkards and innocents
Morgan laughed Which are you
not drunkards she said all sure of
She helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall He said feel a lot better after you have a bath Your feet are in bad shape Mrs. Jones have to go to town to see the doc
No be all right Jones said quickly I mean we have any way to get there and we expect you to quit work just to take us to town
see Morgan said
Could you find me a needle and thread The girl asked My dress needs some work on it
He nodded and going into the bedroom brought a needle thread and scissors He said going to bed He nodded at the door in front of him my spare bedroom The bed made but find plenty of blankets there
awfully kind the girl said pay you back if let us Some way
all right he said I get up early better sleep
Jones followed him into the front room closing the door behind him He said If all right with you Mr. Morgan sleep out here on the couch We slept together since we started I just take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping together
He stopped embarrassed and Morgan said I understand that but I savvy why go off and leave your jobs in the first place
We got fired Jones said We had to do something
They were a pair of lost whipped kids Morgan thought as he went to bed

Gavin paused wearily You stay here with me late and you said be here by dawn
You make me go
Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known Against that other man he could rally his anger against this bent man in the chair he was powerless
Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words Do you remember Big Charlie He whispered He stuck with me all these years Just a half-breed 'pache never said much never meant anythin to me but he stuck with me He got into a fight with Tom English your brother's son It was a fair fight the boy provoked it Big Charlie told me so I believed him They killed Big Charlie dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago My men they all left me Just cleared out I understand why Clay They just all cleared out I treated them fair
He wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder Do you mean he asked almost shyly you want me to go with you wherever goin
Yes
You hate me any more
Clayton choked shook his head murmuring No
Come here The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely All my life he said I tried I tried I saw you driftin away but I tried And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give Now nothin left of me Laurel is gone my men are gone Ed is dead and you come to me to help me Oh God in Heaven I refuse you now That would mock me too much let you go way from me again He closed his eyes ashamed of his tears
go Clay
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back The eyes followed him fearfully The horses There much time saddle the horses and bring them round You get ready
He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket working by touch in the darkness comforting the animal with easy words When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck The mare had backed away You take it easy boy Clayton whispered She want you now You take it easy your time will come
Gavin stood on the porch a thin figure He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand the stock bumping on the wood floor Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps
Clay he said where are we goin
To a ranch in the valley someone there I have to see We may take her with us to California I know yet crazy I have to think about it But California is where goin
California Gavin began to nod a new land A man could make a mark there Two men together like us we could do somethin fine out there maybe find a place where no ever been Start out fresh the two of us like nothin had ever happened
Yes like a father and son
I made you what you are Gavin whispered I made you so you could stand up I made you a man
Yes Gavin you did
He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck Help me up Clay Help me up I feel kind of stiff Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like a child I hate to leave my garden Gavin said trample it down I loved my garden
It will grow again in California
I loved this valley he whispered huskily Lived alone here for three years before any man came Lived alone by the river It was nice then so peaceful and quiet There was no one but me I want to leave it
Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump The two horses broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house into the darkness
Thirty-five they rode at a measured pace through the valley Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever trespassed before It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be broken by the will of men Gavin sighed bitterly In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind He saw them ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately but they would not come to life The silence oppressed him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search
They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills Then at last the darkness began to dissolve A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies
They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence
The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking their faces red and baggy But the liquor had flushed their courage They greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated of purpose Lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked leavin what you wanted it Clayton is with him takin him out of the valley You
Keep out of this Purvis snarled not your brother Gavin's son You see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley He remembered Gavin's smirk his own cringing feeling his impotence Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap His wife had said to him Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy He even dance with her at Gavin's party He treats her like she was dirt And you stand by like a fool and let him do it
He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game Gavin's son Joe Purvis had said
He turned to Lester You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy He meant to help Gavin all the time He made a fool of you Lester He swung round to the other men We can catch him easy There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place If we let them go they stay away find men to ride with them and be back only one way they can get out now and through the Gap if we ride hard we can take them
Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder The boy jerked away
He killed Tom do you understand that Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night He fled through the door and down the steps running and the men grunted and followed pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance
Thirty-six in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line The wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind
The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers They neither gained nor fell back He rode low on the mare's neck Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap no more than a mile away
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement He did not look back he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north He knew who was riding after him the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn their loyalty to him Now they were riding to kill him And he was fleeing running fleeing his death and his life at the same time The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in his valley With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never see again The Gap looming before him the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago was his exit from all that had meaning to him
California is too far he thought He would never reach California He was too old when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead he was passing from life

The sentry was not dead He was in fact showing signs of reviving He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat Mike stripped these from him and donned them He and Dean tied and gagged the man using his belt and shirt for the purpose They dragged him inside the building
Fiske joined them unsteady on his feet Julia seeing the bandage rushed to him You are hurt She breathed
I never felt better in my life Fiske blustered
He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek Thank you My dear he said You are very brave
Mike silenced them talk later First got to get out of here
grab horses Dean said The main bunch is outside but there are some over there inside the wall
Mike debated it trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride But it at least offered him a chance for living He had none here And for the sake of Julia and Susan it had to be tried
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground Someone evidently was on duty there No doubt there would be men guarding the horses
About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade as best Mike could make out in the moonlight Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency
He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride he said stampede the rest You stay with the ladies All of you be ready to ride hell for leather
He added If this work out the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol Susan halted Dean and kissed him She clung to him talking to him and dabbing at her eyes
Mike turned away He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss meant what he had believed it had He felt unutterably weary
Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms He kissed her also and with deep tenderness She too began to weep He released her and joined Mike All right he said
Mike only said Later
Be careful McLish Susan said fiercely
The way you were careful He snorted Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock
He kept going He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her He might say or do something foolish Something all of them would regret He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her And using him Mike McLish as a sop to her pride
He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol Stay well back of me he said going to walk up to the horses bold as brass pretending one of the guerrillas bound to be someone on guard but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close
Holding the pistol concealed he walked to the rear wall of the stockade It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings One wing stood open Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses They were tethered army style on stable lines
A voice spoke near-at-hand that
Just me Mike said Is that you Bill
He located his man The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch
Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol But the luck that had been running their way left him The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body
Mike off balance managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded The bullet went wide Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash This time it connected solidly on the man's temple felling him
The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills The startled horses began rearing on their tethers
Dean came rushing up Are you hit He demanded
No but the in the fire Mike said no chance now of all of us getting away have to try it alone
The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby having been kept handy in case of need
Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line Up you go He said Ride
Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse Why not you He protested
Dammit Mike said frantically lighter than me our only chance now Try to find these Feds The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back the one taking the big chance
Dean still hesitated but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand
No telling how good this horse is Mike panted Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight Take the pistol You might need it still have the rifle and I might be able to round up some more stampede the rest of these horses so they chase you
Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back McLish he said as he kicked the horse into motion be a mighty sad man if we never met again
Then he was on his way at a gallop Mike ran down the line slashing picket ropes with the bayonet He lifted a screeching war whoop That touched off a total stampede He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there These poured through the gate and joined the flight The animals thundered away into the moonlight heading for the ridges
The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure
Apaches Mike yelled stealin' the stock
He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings He crouched there
His shout had been taken up and repeated The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses All were carrying guns they had seized up but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all
Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post They had pistols in their hands They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar They followed the others toward the east gate Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches
Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner The area was deserted A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left but he too suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade
Mike crawled to the door and peered in The orderly room seemed to be deserted A lantern hung from a peg giving light Ducking inside he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner A brace of pistols holstered on belts hung from a peg along with ammunition pouches An ammunition case stood open containing canisters which contained powder cartridges
Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty
Shouldering the load he peered from the door His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas
He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons struck by a new inspiration He set his bundle down Snatching the lantern from its peg he shattered its globe with a blow against a post He picked up the powder canister and ran out Bursting paper cartridges he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it
He shouldered the blanket again backed off and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him They realized the truth Bullets began to snap past him One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack Its force spun him around but he recovered and got into stride again
A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down
Guerrillas were racing toward him Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap
Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal chewing into the planks Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak The iron hinges held but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars
Mike rolled to Susan grasped her around the knees dragging her off her feet He hovered over her to shield her for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls
He peered from a loophole Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away charging the house Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired He dropped a man with the first bullet At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit That halted the rush The guerrillas scattered for cover
The wagons were burning fiercely The mudwagon had caught fire also The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings
The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem Gawdamighty One screeched There goes our grub an' ammunition
Get a bucket line going Calhoun shouted Hurry Hurry
The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring But what few containers they found were inadequate Many of them in increasing panic came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort Both buildings were in flames The heat drove the guerrillas back The roof of the command post began to buckle
Drag the wagons to the spring Lew Durkin yelled Run 'em right into the spring Hustle
One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame A sizable supply of powder had been touched off The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings
The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows giving light enough to examine Mike's wound The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor But it had missed the bone and had passed on through Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury
Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it

So it the earthquake that made him return to his village
No Now dammit I want to go into any more explanations Here comes Jason Keep this to yourself
Reverend Jason looking worried hurried toward us Anything wrong cap'n The men seem to think so
Dirion found a large war party south of us probably attack at dawn Montero said He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted Fort up Fort up a large war party on their way
For a second engages cooks voyageurs appeared struck dumb Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal They all flew into action
That was a terrible thing to do I said to Oso The Aricaras treated us like friends And here all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them God what a world you people live in
Oso gave me an unruffled look Old got the largest war party ever seen on the river he said calmly What would you have done in Montero's moccasins Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people or would you steer him on someone else He shook his head Mr. Manuel did that in the war why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up He did that with all the Nations Hell they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero I saw that letter He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin
But that was war I said no war on now
wrong Matt In this country a war on every time the grass turns green First it was the Nations against themselves then it was them against the whites And goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land
I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight
why this important Once we get over the mountains others will come along why the Trust want us to make it That bastard Chambers Old not the only chief get to do his dirty work Before we get through have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods Well talkin' goin' to help fort up
As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company
For unlike the Sioux and the Crows the Aricaras are not great horsemen nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet More of an agricultural nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains Still I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods
Surprisingly he had told the others what he had done In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river
I think Montero did right Amy said firmly Let the savages kill each other What do we care
Reverend Jason was understandably bitter It was a terrible thing to do Those little children
But Oso replied calmly Trouble easy to dodge out in this country rev'rend
28 Attack Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky Our camp was in the center of a wide valley Montero had set up a strong position using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire
The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors
The cooks had prepared one of the best meals had in a long time and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day Buckets were filled the herd fed and watered The worst part had been the waiting although we expect the attack before dawn the long cloudy night filled with the sounds of the industrious insects seemed endless Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl Oso slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms I catch a wink Every time I closed my eyes I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife
It was a relief when they finally came
They poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry
Oso Montero called get Gray Eyes
be a pleasure to see the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle
Hold your fire Montero was shouting Wait until my shot shoot the first man who
I could see them in my sights They were about a mile off under me the ground quivered slightly At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies hunched over their horses' heads Gradually they emerged as men Gray Eyes was in the lead His face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest He was naked except for a clout Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions His mouth was open his neck corded with the strain of his screams I found his chest in my sights It had a red circle The circle came nearer and nearer
My God how long is he going to wait I thought
Montero's rifle cracked At first I thought he had missed Gray Eyes remained erect The feathered lance was still above his head As he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse
I squeezed the trigger At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head bouncing like a rubber ball He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing He jerked once in the grass and lay still
If goin' to kill 'em Kill 'em Oso growled
What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled and retreated
Lead up Lead up be back Montero was shouting
Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and wounded and dead horses The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses and the bitterness of burned powder A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy A rifle cracked the square head fell over One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek His legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him There was a ragged volley He was dead before he hit the ground
For Christ's sake waste your powder on one of 'em Montero shouted furiously Wait for the charge The charge I tell you
The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint They grew louder as the Indians charged again I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open shouting their spine-chilling cries
Gray Eyes is back Montero said
The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat I could see the blood running down his chest He was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he started to slump
I forgot to aim In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest there was no doubt he was dying Again we waited for Montero This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically but they held their fire The horses were only several lengths away when he fired The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts But a few reached our wall I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale firing four arrows in such rapid succession it seem possible they were in flight Men screamed Oso reached up jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck Other Indians were running at the ponies shrilling and waving blankets Reverend Jason got one the Canadians the others I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position
The ponies were almost uncontrollable The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again This time more of them hurdled the barrier A small Indian dived at Montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt It sounded like a man kicking a melon Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales
Although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me I could smell woodsmoke grease and oil His eyes were dark fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil Now under me I could see him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint
The Aricaras made one last desperate charge It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses Others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under the slashing hoofs Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts
None of them reached our walls again The few survivors grudgingly turned away In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song

She was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist
I saw your fire she said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size It matter to a fool like you It would to me
All right Wilson said quickly The too big And I appreciate the advice
He was losing patience again An hour before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness he would have appreciated company She had helped him change his mind
not advising you she said telling you That too big Let it burn down And make sure out when you leave in the morning
He was taken aback It took him a long time to compose himself
some mistake he said finally right about the fire bigger than it has to be though I see where doing any harm But wrong about the rest of it not leaving in the morning Why should I I own the place
She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face It seem to tell her anything She glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight She studied it for a long time Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled and he quite sure what she meant by it
You own this place She said and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly You bought it
From a man in St. Louis Wilson said Jake Carwood Maybe you know him
The girl laughed I know him I ought to My father ran him off here six years ago
Wilson say anything He stood watching the girl wondering what was coming next She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him
Carwood tell you that she said
No Wilson said But understandable not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of And it make any difference He sold me a clear title I have it with me right here If you want to see
Never mind she said sternly It matter to my father and not to me I meant what I said about that fire Be sure out when you leave all let you go back to doing the dishes now
It was meant to insult him and quite succeed He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly and it was his turn to smile now I mind washing dishes now and then he said pleasantly It hurt It might hurt you though Somebody might mistake you for a woman
He meant to say more but he never got the chance She was quick She brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried to step back She swung the quirt again and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle
She came down against him and he tried to break her fall He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him It made him a little sick and he let go of her He got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood facing her He wiped the blood from his cheek
I ought to he said He was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful gasps That quirt I ought to use it on you where it would do the most good If you were a man
She mister
The voice came from behind him and Wilson turned The fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the trees But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light and Wilson had a good look at him He was tall and dark-skinned a half-breed Wilson thought And he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek
not a man mister he said I am If got any ideas He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest
Put the rifle down Joseph the girl said She seemed irritated I thought I told you to stay home
The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap The scar looked pure white in the half-darkness his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless You be riding up here after dark Judith he said quietly I can take care of this no job for you
The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him He took it without flinching
I said go home Joseph got no business up here
The half-breed answer this time But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry It made Wilson wonder He watched the half-breed as he turned silently They could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the sound faded out
Wilson brushed the dust from his coat Who was that He asked Your personal guard pretty hard on him
He works for my father the girl said and then seemed to change her mind a friend His Joseph Sanchez Is there anything else you want to know
Not now Wilson said I guess find out soon enough got blood on your cheek Not yours Mine It must have got there when you fell against me
She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat
bet as close as been to a man since you were a baby Wilson said
He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist Oh no he said and he was without humor now had enough of that had enough of you I know what goes on around here and I care I know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business and I care about that either You took me by surprise But know how to handle you next time
She brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker He side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before He had forgotten that she was so pretty But her prettiness was what he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward cruelty meanness self-will He had known women like that one woman in particular And one had been too many He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees and waited until he hear the sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were sleeping
They sleeping of course but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending He shown up too well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman They expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances and they were disappointed And determined not to show it They lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed
Go to sleep he said Both of you better things to do than listen to something like that be down at the creek finishing the dishes if you want me
He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream The coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it Not tonight at any rate He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble If she did he could stand it better in the light
He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had been high Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia's death Not all of it There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief But they were starting a new life And they had almost everything they needed land a house two whiteface bulls three horses
The land all Wilson had expected of it Six hundred and forty acres the old man back in St. Louis had said good grass good water Well the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it The water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard And there was a house livable perhaps but badly in need of repairs
In the last analysis though Wilson had little cause to complain The place had been cheap just the little he had left after Amelia's burial and it would serve its purpose There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry the peace and quiet It started out that way And he had a feeling thanks to the girl that things would get worse before they got better
2 They had the house cleaned up by noon and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness and finally went over to help him Kathy was already in the wagon They were going to town and they were both excited
Wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they going to town at all He had an uneasy feeling about it That girl last night what was her name Judith Pierce It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember
He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem There was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow under and places so steep that cattle stop to graze But there was water There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard Yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble There were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres
The first part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley It was hotter once they reached the flat and drier but the grass was better A warm breeze played across it moving it like waves A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville
The town was about what Wilson expected one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel all dusty and sunbaked The place was quiet

Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all I was nearly thirty at the time
I went to the hall in the afternoons only on these preliminary matters It was dark and I sensed very large only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness I would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded A glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most Drifting here and there Squatting as if waiting The pulsing glow of a cigarette Since they could see me but I not them their presence in the hall disturbed me The clerk paid them no attention This impressed me until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence His job simply consisted in registering new men When the phone rang he answered it His authority extended to the far edge of the counter no further None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him Baldness was attacking his pate He spoke to me in a gruff voice an affectation which quite belied his personality He wore his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was But it was not easy for him and he often slipped When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced I felt certain he was really a spineless little man His hat the cause of his baldness hung on a hook on the wall and underneath it I could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck The morning's tabloids were on the counter and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines On a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music Everything about the clerk was trivial Once pressing him I learned that his job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air When he saw me coming he turned his radio off He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence then bark into it with gruff importance What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me In the mornings I was informed fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall They and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words I was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning Now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand He afford to have anyone mess around with them he said Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient I withdrew my hand Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket
Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself When suitably lighted what would it look like The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air One afternoon upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall By counting the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended I could observe the two fans down at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison I had for some time been hoping in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where I could not tell It was I felt possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently This sort of petty vigilance annoyed me I felt certain it was self-appointed It sprang from a type of mentality encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed
I felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance I lived in a state of suspense because of it I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to I had signed it off on the forms My future lay solely with the hall yet what did I know about the hall at this point Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing I did not despair however far from it I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town its character was wholly foreign to me Large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted The river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs The sounds issuing from beyond winches whirring men shouting indicated great activity and excited me The hall on the other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons It resembled nothing ever seen before Its front was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street I kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there
I returned to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk As I had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer At last when I put it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual When I asked him what if anything I could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall I could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten o'clock The clerk impressed this upon me that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock When I went for my interview with the director I saw why Although it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people Cigarette butts littered the floor The big fans were going drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men I stopped by the counter No one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office I noticed for the first time a door which had been left partially open Past it I could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor The director's office I rapped my knuckles on the counter The director came to the door I was at once disappointed although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained He was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium height he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar He wore perforated white-topped shoes they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment But he came toward me sedately enough showed me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application I had the impression that he had read my forms perhaps several times He did not look at them now As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall He spoke in a voice as immaculate as his appearance Why had I registered Begging my pardon he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there indeed my scholastic qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them Was I sure he asked that I knew what I was applying for What sort of men I would come into contact with at the hall These questions did not surprise me I felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle a dark and unwelcome place Though I doubted that he would understand me I told the director my motives for applying I had always I said hankered after working hard with my hands This desire I went on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence

The flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head
Tie him up
Hell with it
Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head hard The man went over without sound falling to the bare floor
Barton said harshly Why did you do that
Rankin sneered at him What did you want me to do kiss him He dumped me in solitary twice
Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around
get one thing straight you and me The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out If you ever try anything without my orders kill you
Fred Rankin looked at him It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him the thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now
Come on move
They filed out through the guard-room door into the paved square There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate but they were in other cell blocks There was no chance They moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall There was no moon They had chosen this night purposely They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above and Powers slipped through the door
Two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed They looked up in surprise as Powers came in
What are you doing out of the block
Curtiss he said naming the man Rankin had hit got to have help
They stared at him The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet
wrong with him
having some kind of a fit
The sergeant turned to the door As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side
One sound and dead
The sergeant froze Powers had not followed Powers was covering the remaining guard The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell Powers knocked his arm aside Deliberately with none of Rankin's viciousness he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head
They were free Even Barton could not quite believe it It had gone without a hitch They slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark ground Five minutes later they reached the horses Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short
No one hurried They walked the horses heading along the river Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night
The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts
Five miles
In a small grove against the river they halted turning deep into the protection of the trees Foster had brought extra clothing also A good man Emmett He had been one of the original Night Riders one who had escaped the trial It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison
Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt Kid Boyd was unusually silent Rankin watchful a few paces apart Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers
I even try to thank you
The ex-prison guard was embarrassed He said in a studied voice I do it for you I did it for the valley the only man the Night Riders will follow been starving and I like to starve
Barton turned away his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse
Good luck
The murderer lifted his head Meaning you want me to ride out
You one of us nothing for you here
I got no place to go
Barton hesitated He did not trust Rankin his violent temper his killer instinct But ten years in prison had taught him realities They were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and money It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to call them Night Riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the other side
Your choice he said briefly and turned to Kid Boyd Bury those uniforms so they be found
Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off up the river bank He wanted a careful uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley
They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over silently He too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months without the solace of tobacco
Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled
Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly For his first five years in prison they had shared a cell
Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money He had done time for the theft
The one thing they had in common was their hatred Both hated Donald Kruger It had drawn them together and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape
He said now got the perfect headquarters set up The old Haskell mine
Mitch Barton knew the place Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley They had spent a million dollars carving in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned
The road's washed badly said Dill but a trail you can get over with a horse A company of cavalry come in there if two men were guarding that trail
Barton nodded How do the valley people feel
As mad as ever But Kruger's men keep them off balance and they trust me an outsider When they learn in the hills though rally worry about that
Barton waited for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind
My boy Did you find him
Dill was silent as if he hated to answer and Barton had a cold sick feeling of apprehension
in Morgan's Ferry
Barton half-straightened in surprise
he doing there
Again Dill hesitated Dealing faro
Dealing faro How come
Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon
Barton cursed under his breath After another long pause he asked How many people know who they are
Everyone Your cousin Finley saw to that quite a rat you know He sold out to Kruger's men informed them of everything ever written him He wants your ranch
Barton stood up He said tensely All right go get the boy
Dill had come up also I was afraid of this I almost tell you
If you have killed you
Dill's voice tightened But you ride into the Ferry what expect you to do be there waiting for you I understand how you feel about the child
The hell you do Barton's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it I never saw him My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away
I leave him there Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage and I entrust a snake to his tender care got to get the boy ride
Chapter two Barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult It was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state
It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences
For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence
Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit The office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove The building was dwarfed by the scene outside There a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside
The gravel was the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth It was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices A million dollars' of gold a month A million tons of rock and soil and brush
The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day Their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles Hague like all who worked near the pits was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums
He was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt Ten years older than Mitch Barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation
He was proud of his accomplishments proud of his job proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him He lived and breathed for the mining company
No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life
There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke The man was tall thin with a narrow face and a too-large nose The eyes always held Hague eyes of a dead man lidless as a lizard's with the fixed intensity of a cobra Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke
He knew nothing about the man's history Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger Kodyke was to head the dread company police He ran the change rooms He threw out the hi-graders He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco
Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype
This is Mitchell Barton He broke out of Folsom last night Apparently he bribed one of the guards We want him back there or we want him dead
Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully
Dangerous
Dangerous yes You know how the ranchers in the valley are They blame us for all their troubles Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them We want Barton's Night Riders loose again
The gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing
Normally Hague wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said

If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it
After they had finished eating Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother She had offered to walk but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called Auntie
When they reached their neighbor's house Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought of the type to which she was frequently subject these days that they might never see one another again Then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination
As she drove she thought about her plan It was really quite simple So simple in fact that it might even work although Pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend too much assurance That mistake she thought had cost her dearly these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest
When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house Pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped All of her movements were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime She locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and went into the house Here she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom
On her bureau lay a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving an object which Pamela believed now had been the property of her great-grandfather Major Hiram Munroe Culver He had belonged to this land and perhaps had desecrated it and this was the only material symbol that remained of him If she Pamela were being held responsible for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation She would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice
Slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out of the house There was only one place where the mountain might receive her that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom Atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred sacrificial basin It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation beg forgiveness
Perhaps it was insane Pamela thought Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream But she was caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were a dream it was one from which she might never awaken
Facing the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it
The forest was open and freely welcoming extending an enchanted hand The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time It was not thought Pamela such an evil place after all No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning
Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed Was it not possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this
Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants
Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them A few days ago she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous today on the contrary it seemed utterly reasonable
She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal If as she walked her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to heed Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest
The forest took on an impersonal aspect It did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes Unconcerned indifferent unmotivated the forest was simply there fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter Red man or white man pacifist or killer the forest would accept them all knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man
Pamela shook her head She must not think about time That was another one of those traps
In her grim pursuit of tranquillity Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband If when this was all over she found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever understand How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor His bright daylight mind would whistle away such images they would not dare to face his scoffing
Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near His presence would have interfered with her duty
The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles The trees huddled more closely together their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction
Nevertheless she continued to move upward She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles The forest had become an alien world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever hindrances were offered It was a bold dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human time At one and the same time she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry
Silence came into the forest a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees Silence walked at Pamela's side its presence numbingly close yet too far for her to hear Silence stood in front of her waiting and in back of her blocking her retreat
She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone For a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet laboriously She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes Her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in pain
She looked around She was bewildered She seemed to have come such a long distance too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees She stood quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide her
She was standing in a thick grove The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely The earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays She had the feeling that under the mouldering leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain
The thought made Pamela shudder A terrible chill swept through the grove Not a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching Pamela in a leering embrace There was a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived
Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene She already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive It enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin It crawled across her breasts suffocating the life in her nipples It circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws
She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her of reason and sight But she did not know which way to go The shadows of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the grove She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles
She could not scream for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth who would hear who would listen
Does the mountain listen
Pamela groped blindly She had to escape She had to move in some direction any direction that would take her away from this evil place
She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back Her own body protested aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed
Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy Twigs cracked loudly under her feet bushes swished and scratched at her slacks tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her

Miraculously she found exactly the right statement She began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him
I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord well aware that got a pedigree as long as my leg and that I amount to anything But
But it matter a-tall Lord supplied fondly To me always be the girl o' my dreams an' the sweetest flower that grows
Beaming idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her She yanked away from him furiously
You shut up Shu-tt up-pp got something to say to you and by God going to listen Do you hear me going to listen
Lord nodded agreeably He said he wanted very much to listen He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important as well as pleasin' to the ear and he want to miss a word of it So would she mind speaking a little louder
I think you stink Tom Lord I think mean and hateful and stupid and louder Said Joyce
Uh-huh So I can hear you while checkin' the car Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble
He opened the door and got out He waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly
Well you goin' to say somethin' Then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence Maybe you could write it down for me huh Print it in real big letters an' I can cipher it out later
Aah go on she said Just go the hell on
He grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car Lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring
He went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination After a time he straightened again brushing the red Permian dust from his hands slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar shirt
He wore no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country Never once told Joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun And he really feels that way she thought really all got all he is Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package If I could make myself feel the same way
She studied him hopefully yearningly against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis Here in the God-forsaken place the westerly end of nowhere Tom Lord looked almost insignificant almost contemptible
He was handsome with his coal-black hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features But known plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there left He a big man rather on the medium side Neither was he very powerful of build He could move very quickly she knew although he seldom found occasion to do so but he was more wiry than truly strong And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance
Just nothing she told herself Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone But by gosh I want him and going to have him
He caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer teetering half-mincing walk Why did these yokels still wear boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years He slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered one to her
Oh cut it out Tom She snapped you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute
This your brand maybe Lord suggested Or maybe you just feel like a cigar
I feel like getting back to town what I feel like Now are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk
Might get there faster walkin' Lord drawled seein' as how I got a busted front spring On the other hand howsomever maybe you either I figger probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk and I c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours
How with what nothing out here but rattlesnakes
Now it the truth Lord laughed with secret amusement Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so I reckon get the boss rattler to help me
Tom For God's sake
Looky He pointed cutting her off See that wildcat
She saw it then the distant derrick of the wildcat a test well in unexplored country And even with her limited knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired there sufficiently at least to get them back into town A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency He had to depend on himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others
Well get going she said impatiently I She broke off frowning What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you
Why I meant what I said Lord declared What else would I mean anyways
She looked at him lips compressed Then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up In his mood it was the best way to handle him that is to show no curiosity whatsoever Otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum teased and provoked until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood
The car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against the road itself Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel He seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned Along with this self-satisfaction however Joyce sensed a growing tension It poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that action would be all that he anticipated
Joyce had seen him like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company
Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of line McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip He had a legitimate reason for wearing it It was payday for Highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields Moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it
So this all about He demanded when Lord confronted him not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit
It was the wrong thing to say By failing to do as he was told instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to his car he had played into Lord's hands
The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him
So How about it He said Why single me out on this permit deal
Well tell you about that Lord told him We aim t' be see-lective like to bother no one unless we have to which I figger we do in your case Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots
McBride reddened He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company but that had nothing to do with him He was an honest man doing a hard job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable
Look Lord he said hoarsely I know got a grudge against me and maybe I blame you You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped 'em do it But all wrong man no lawyer I just do what told and
uh-huh An' that could mean trouble with a fella workin' for crooks So you get rid of that pistol right now Mis-ter McBride You do that or take you out a permit right now
McBride do either of course Not immediately as the deputy demanded Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot How could he exert authority over them make them toe the line as he had to if he knuckled under to this small-town clown
get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately Just as soon as I go to the bank and
huh-uh Now Mis-ter McBride said Lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm
It was strictly the deputy's game but McBride had gone too far to throw in Now he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck
He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a storefront
It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition
Lord slugged him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine Then as he doubled gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten Lord straightened him with an uppercut A rabbit punch redoubled him And then there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach
But he keep up with them No more could he defend himself against them He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen And he could no longer think of face-saving of honor but only of escape
Why going to kill me he thought wildly I meant him no harm given willful hurt to no man I was just doing my job just following orders and for that going to kill me Beat me to death in front of a hundred people
Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished He McBride would be cited as in the wrong and he Lord would go scot-free an officer who had only done his duty though perhaps too energetically
McBride staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust Fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled to his feet again He see he was long past the point of coherent thinking Dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but he could not read the racket properly He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air
He hated them too much to understand the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world This he was sure was the way they would act laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death And nothing would be done about it Nothing unless
Donna Donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him Donna was like he was She lived by the rules never compromising never blinded or diverted by circumstance And Donna would
When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house in the office of Doctor Lord the deputy's deceased father

The Brannon outfit known as the Slash-B because of its brand reached Hondo Creek before sundown The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground Two of the new hands a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo were picked for the first trick of riding night herd
The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes lounged about There was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit It especially bothered the older hands
The cook Mateo Garcia had arrived there long before the herd started a fire and put coffee on and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven Supper would be ready within the hour
The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire and his wife was busy at it now Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing Conchita nagged at the younger children attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon
Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it which had been at midday come alone without his wife and child been in an angry mood Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him
She wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife She wished that she could talk to her mother about it Not that her mother knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none of her concern
Pat get out of that creek You too Sean Elena get mud all over your dress
Even as she called to the children Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon Tomas she called him as the Mexican hands did He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero Luis Hernandez Whatever they are talking about Conchita wondered
It bothered her that she probably would never know Certainly she dare ask her father afterward He would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs as though she were a little kid like Elena
At the moment the three men were not saying much of anything They were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still empty calf wagon Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel with the other two facing him He held a cigarette in his right hand It was burning away forgotten His face was clouded with unhappiness
told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do They were considering it gravely neither seeming to like what he planned
Finally Hernandez said I could offer you advice Tomas but you heed it
hear it anyway
Wait a little while Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time Give her time to miss you Maybe she will then come to you After all you want the senora as much as you want the boy You need her even more than you need him
She change her mind Brannon said John Clayton will see to that
But after a time away from you
A year Luis Five Ten How long should I wait Maybe in a year Tomas
In a year like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to me Brannon said flatly And the boy will be too much under his influence by then got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether Hell in a year or five or ten the boy will have forgotten me his own father
But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good
In my place follow such advice as you give me
Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain That I answer for I imagine something like this happening to me Maybe I should withdraw my advice no
Brannon looked at Hank Maguire And you What would you do in my place
Hank shook his head I know Tom Like Luis I see something like this happening to me With Maria and me never any problem Where I go she goes and the kids with us going to need your woman And the boy will need his mother If you take the one better take both
Brannon shook his head I force Beth to come against her will But going to have my son
They were silent for a little while each looking glum
Finally Luis Hernandez said What must be must be I am with you of course Tomas
And Hank Maguire added So am I Tom
All right Brannon said rising ride out as soon as had chuck
Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east Later heard the rumble of thunder and then just outside Rockfork they ran into rain Those who had slickers donned them The others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles
There were seven of them enough for a show of strength to run a bluff It was to be nothing more than that There was to be no gunplay If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble Brannon had told the others they would withdraw and he would come after his son another time He want to put himself outside the law
With him were Hank Maguire Luis Hernandez and Luis's son Pedro The Ramirez brothers were also along The seventh man was Red Hogan a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising They were all good men
It was dark early because of the storm Also because of the storm the streets of Rockfork were deserted Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour They reined in before the town marshal's office a box-sized building on Main Street A lamp burned inside but Brannon peering through the window saw that the office was empty hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there
Probably just stepped out he said Maybe to have supper Red come along The rest of you wait here
With Red Hogan he rode to the Welcome Cafe Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside Not there he said getting back onto his horse Maybe at the hotel
They rode to the Rockfork House a little farther along the opposite side of the street They reined in there Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room Brannon had no slicker put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked But he felt no physical discomfort He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder
Hogan reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps
finished eating Hogan said Sitting with a cup of coffee now It be long
It seemed long at least to Tom Brannon He and Hogan waited by the door one to either side Macklin was the third man to come out and he came unhurriedly He was puffing on a cigar and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and then it was too late They closed in fast kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun
Just come along Brannon told him start anything you finish
Now listen Macklin began
talk over at your office
Brannon I warn you go Marshal Brannon said and took him by the arm
Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office The other five Slash-B men followed them inside crowding the small room His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms He looked at each of them in turn Brannon last of all
remember you he said Every last one of you As for you Brannon
Put your gun on the desk Marshal
Now hold on damn it I
Red Hogan's patience ran out He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the desk Too much fooling around he said press your luck badge-toter
Brannon said Now the key to the lockup Marshal
Key Macklin said What for
you guess Brannon said putting you where you come to harm Come on the key Get it out
Damned if I will Brannon assaulted a law officer and
They moved in on him crowded him from all sides No man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was there His face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing He held out a moment longer then his nerve gave under the pressure
He swore and said All right here in my pocket
Get it out Brannon ordered Then as Macklin obeyed Now go out back
Resignedly Macklin turned to the back door They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron It was secured by an oversized padlock Macklin balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door They crowded him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in Once the door was open they crowded him inside the dark building He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door
They returned to the street mounted their horses rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street Its windows glowed with lamplight Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark He came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand on his gun
try it Brannon told him dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following get yourself killed for something that concern you
He strode past the now frightened man entered the house Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering The others followed Brannon inside They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle They tracked mud on the oaken floor on the carpet Their presence fouled the elegance of that room
And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard

The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second But the day of the deadline came and passed and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction For with a single exception nothing had happened to them
The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis After walking out to his corral that morning been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet A split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which estimated the shot had come But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near
Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing He even pretended to be farming his spread His land had never been plowed He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it He had received both first and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them He had cursed at them and threatened them He was a man those neighbors testified later who have a friend in the world
William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet and once more he accused and threatened everyone
be ready next time He raged be shootin' right back
He had his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happened again This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot then spent most of the day searching out the area He found nothing but he still refused to give up and move out
Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face He exploded all I ask
He never got that chance For the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time A bullet smashed directly into the center of William Lewis' chest He slumped against a log fence rail then tried to lift himself Two more shots followed in quick succession dropping him limp and huddled on the ground
An inquest was held and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney a Colonel Baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning
It took some time to locate Horn He was finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County two counties away Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment But that indictment was never made For Tom Horn it turned out had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing
The former scout's alibi be shaken The authorities had to release him He immediately rode on to Cheyenne threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends
Dead center at three hundred yards that coroner said grin Three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground You reckon two men in this state can shoot like that
Publicly he denied everything Privately he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job promised to do
Tom Horn was soon back at work giving his secret employers their money's worth A good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats The company herds were being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his neighbors The rustling problem was by no means solved
Even in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still disappearing For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell
Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle his own hired man Andy Ross mentioned later Everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he care who knew it even after them notes came even after heard about Lewis even after been shot at a couple o' times hisself
On the morning of September 10 1895 Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work Haying time was close at hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack Harnessing a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping
Andy Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded He looked around in surprise then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest The hired man ran over to help his boss
My God shot Powell gasped And he collapsed and died instantly
Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing
A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots Not even an empty cartridge case could be found
Once again Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately Once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready Later riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made
Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me blandly announce And I sort o' got a corner on the market
Tom a friend asked him once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers They o' stood no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down
He had lots of friends then as always Even as he became widely known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend No man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo
Well he explained s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope Which would you be most scairt of a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down
Yeah I can see that the friend was forced to agree But well it just seem sportin' somehow
Sportin' The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement Sportin' He echoed again in soft wonder I seen a lot o' things in my time I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we ran across some teamsters caught tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death But one thing I never seen or heard of one thing I just think there is and a sportin' way o' killin' a man
After the first two murders the warning notes were rarely ignored The lesson had been learned The examples were plain When Fred Powell's brother-in-law Charlie Keane moved into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice
If you leave this country within 3 days your life will be taken the same as Powell's was
This was the message found tacked to the cabin door Keane left within three days
All through Albany and Laramie counties other men were doing the same Houses of settlers treated the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards The small half-heartedly tended fields of men spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer Jury judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated
For three straight years Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell if he killed Lewis and Powell will never be known It is possible although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state It is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him
For that legend was growing explosively Rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest
One thing was certain his method was effective so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week
My reputation's my stock in trade Tom mentioned more than once He evidently foresee that it might be his downfall in the end
He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown He made their spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups
In the cow camps Tom Horn was regarded as a hero as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life The wailing guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him
By 1898 rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming

When several minutes had passed and Curt emerged from the livery stable Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter
I have a little job for you Charlie sure you mind doing me a small favor
Brenner's voice was oily but Summers fooled He moistened his lips uneasily
What is it you want me to do Mr. Brenner
Brenner shrugged carelessly
very simple I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari Tell her to come here to the hotel
Vastly relieved Summers nodded and started toward the door
One thing Summers Brenner said not to mention my name Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her
Summers pulled up short and turned around
I know Mr. Brenner he said haltingly beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans It seem quite right telling her a thing like that I just His voice trailed off into silence
Brenner continued to smile but his eyes were cold He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he before noticed
You know Summers he said thoughtfully Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company If someone were to drop a match in here this place would go up like a haystack He started toward the stairway then turned to add Tell her to come to Adams's room that Adams is in trouble Tell her to hurry
Yes sir His face pale Summers headed for the street
Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside
The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong but Curt interpret it this way A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding
From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street Curt approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees
There was a light in Black's front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior Curt circled the house and located a barn out back He could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else There was no lock on the door only an iron hook which he unfastened He opened the door and went in pulling it shut behind him
Again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor He moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden partition Horse smell was very strong and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws He found a match in his pocket and lit it
There were two horses in the barn a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin Curt snuffed out the match
It was certain now that Jess was in the house but also presumably was Stacey Black Curt wanted to get Jess alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person as the store owner
He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved Reaching across the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall
As Curt had hoped the house door banged open He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of the stall
Curt moved over beside the door and waited Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard and Jess's smothered curses The door swung open and Jess said sourly What the the matter with you
The horse continued to snort Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice
Jess cursed again and entered the barn A match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop As he crossed to the side of the stall Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer
Before you try anything he said Remember what happened to Gruller
Jess caught his breath in surprise He started to reach for his gun but apparently thought better of it
the stuff Curt said Just hold it that way He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt You and I have a little talking to do Jess You be needing this He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster
Damn you Adams Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock We got nothing to talk about If I come back in the house going to
Your trigger-happy brother in the house About now probably having supper That long ride the four of you took given him a good appetite Now turn around so I can see your face
Jess turned There was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen
about as dumb as they come Adams I know what up to but when Brenner
You can forget about Brenner too Curt said Ben Arbuckle going to talk about
Arbuckle Jess stiffened I know nothin' about him
No I suppose you know anything about a piece of two-by-four either one with blood all over it Arbuckle's blood Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun So help me Crouch like to kill you where you stand but before I do going to hear you admit killing him Now start talking Who told you to do it Was it Dutch Brenner
Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face but finish the motion Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess but Curt bring himself to do it
Apparently sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage Jess became bold
Having all the guns makes you a big man it Adams If we was both armed you talk so tough
No Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster He retreated a step and holstered his own
All right Crouch on even terms Now draw
Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw but he reach for the gun
Curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands shoulder high
Does this make it any easier coward
I drawin' against you Jess said thickly I heard how you outdrew Chico I a gunslinger
No the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club I just wanted to hear you say so
Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides He had found Curt's weakness or what to Jess was a weakness and was smart enough to take advantage of it
Somewhere in the distance a woman screamed Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention He had to make Jess talk and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin He dropped his own beside it
do it another way then he said harshly
Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack
Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section It was like hitting a sack of salt Pain shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit He slammed into the wall bounced back and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning An inch lower and it would have knocked him out As it was his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move When his eyes began to focus he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork
Curt twisted to one side and the tines of the fork bit into the floor Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet
The tines broke off under Jess's twisting and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out His aim was hurried so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head
By now Curt was seeing clearly again He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly putting everything he had behind them They made Jess double over When his head came down Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall
The building shook setting the lantern to swaying and the buckskin to pitching again Even Black's old crowbait began to snort and from the house Black yelled Jess going on out there
Jess seem too sure himself He lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor
Jess had had enough Blood gushed from his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists
Curt was in almost as bad shape but he quit He backed Jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront and drew back his right fist
Tell me about Arbuckle You killed him you
It was Brenner's idea Jess mumbled dabbing at his nose He found out about you and Arbuckle talking He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble
You mean anyone who stood up for his rights Curt said He let go of the shirt and Jess slumped to the floor Turning his back Curt crossed to the stall reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope and waved his hand in the animal's face
The buckskin bolted out of the stall Curt moved in and picked up his gun He shook loose straw out of the action and placed the gun in his holster Leaving Jess's where it lay he left the stall
Get up Crouch going someplace
Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door
in there Black called fearfully
Curt opened the door grabbed Black by the shoulder and pulled him into the barn
staying right here for a while This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle going to let him tell it to somebody else He shoved Black toward the stall and pointed his pistol at Jess
Get out of here coming along peacefully or put a bullet in your leg
Jess stumbled through the door Curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it Black would have little trouble getting out but it might delay him a few minutes
you takin' me Jess asked worriedly
going to Marshal Woods's house Maybe if the marshal hears this himself make a difference Somebody in this town must still have some backbone

Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' glowering faces Honey he whispered Soon as we send them on their way and make camp you and me go for a walk down by the Snake all by ourselves
Sally admonished her mother got all evening to visit with Dan His wounds need dressing now
Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting What a spectacle he was caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap Got a lot to tend to but get back quick as I can he assured her
Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen Jackson was doing most of the talking So long as Sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle Dan feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth
Soon as the Burnsides moved on lead Rex down by the river there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening Damn it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve If I got Nate stopped when I did my all be shot plumb to hell
He stooped picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully From the way the wound in his head was itching Dan knew that it would heal But his only hat was something else again Nate Nate He shouted
The Burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his cry
Nate He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him
I going to fight you no more Nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice
I know you Dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall He moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate's head and clamped it on his own a present for you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling forehead Me and trading hats so's have something permanent to remember me by
Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan Slipping her hand in his they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight Much as they had to look forward to they begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go
At first Matilda could not believe her own eyes She had spent too many hours looking ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness And now she could see him looking uncommon handsome standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon
Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them Matilda could not speak at all Then with a glory that almost wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon Pa Pa I can see Dan And with the Jacksons
What about Burnsides Hez asked who still believed have them to lick
They even in sight She replied
By then Hez could see for himself and so could the others Soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel carried water and started their cooking fires Then and only then with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action The wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals From then on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood the whole group settled down to relish their food Even Sally in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag
After their supper the evening turned into a regular Hoe-Down Only they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting Glory Be and Hallelujah above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration
Golly Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators that fiddle make you wish the Bible say us Baptists dance
Nor Methodists neither she replied Not that it matters to me being this far along
Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied Come spring be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal
At these words of sympathy and understanding Harmony said generously I mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games
Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply I much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell but sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers reckon nobody out there 'cept maybe Dan who can outgrip me Harmony
With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that might have happened to Sally And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing Farmer in the dell Farmer in the dell Heigh-ho the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell
At the sight of Sally's happy face and carefree expression Harmony's dark brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears She was glad completely and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod But she not yet Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close
Out in the center of the circle the farmer who was Dan wasted no time when they came to the line The farmer choose his wife With a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their outfit Soon the child the dog the cat and even the cheese all joined them out there in the circle
By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them
No sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep For Matilda it was the first she had known in many a night Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains
Next morning they moved on again
My souls' a-gracious Gran Harrow exclaimed watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud
Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins Shucks Gran they said almost in unison That nothing at all
Leaning forward in her chair Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan's face Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush a-raising
Quit ragging him Gran Rod protested
I ragging him Gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip But honest-to-Betsy seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon
The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice
Rheumatics worse Pa Dan asked Hez who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends
My right stiff as a board this morning he replied But the fry it me onct we git to rolling
The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens' signal
Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock official signboard for the Raft River turnoff and gloated Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar
Wonder what made them hurry so Rod drawled giving Dan a sly wink
Dan grinned and changed the subject From now on Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit
no sense you eating our dust Rod protested
Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along Dan explained Jackson recruited his critters and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up got the tightest running gear in the train now Besides no right for me to follow with my black oxen so's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch
Captain Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams
Reckon right Dan Hez called back over his shoulder shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon
Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing precipice-walled gorge double teams zigzagging up the mountain Harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched look around her mouth Like enough all be up on top by sundown
Out of the corner of his eye he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn
Before Harmony had a chance to reply Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs

While no larger than Dutch Springs this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them
be holdin' forth in some bar if here at all Cobb declared glancing along the street as they stretched their legs
There were no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters Pat only nodded Take one side of the street and take the other he proposed If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in
Cobb's assent was tight You do the same all I ask Stevens
Separating they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually even were he to prove the thief He tramped out of the Miners Rest with his hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon the last place of any consequence on this side of the street
The Palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch The front windows of the place were long and narrow reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior Heading for the batwings Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside Nerves tight as a bowstring he paused to gather his wits
Against all expectation Carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him Fierce anger surged through Russ He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot
Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he feverishly scanned the busy street below Stevens was nowhere in sight Muffling an exclamation Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down As luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared
What luck Cobb He said swiftly
Russ pointed upward there he got out tersely curbing his rising excitement Hitching his cartridge belt around Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side
Climbing the steps steadily they reached the top and headed for the door Pat pushed through first Forced behind him momentarily Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside His eyes widened While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen
A man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass Looking the setup over Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place
Where yuh goin'
It was the barkeep Halting Pat turned to survey him deliberately He did not reply going on toward the back Less assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead Cobb followed alertly a hand on his gun butt The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it He said no more
A hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell Pat moved into it Small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side All the doors were open at this hour except one and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder
The door was locked A single kick made it spring open shuddering Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside With a bellow Carmer lunged at him But he was more than half-drunk and his faculties were dulled Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan He started to struggle up heaving desperately Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach Kneeling Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned
Okay Stevens drawn his fangs he snapped Go through his pockets will you If we have to take him apart and see what made of
Complying methodically Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing Cobb watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer's hat which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell Cobb got it Straightening up his eyes ablaze he held out the battered Stetson
Look at this
Inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency Carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found
By golly Stevens You were right Russ exclaimed tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat That is if we can be sure this is Colcord's money
Pat grunted Where else would he get it Count what got there Cobb We can soon tell
Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly Pat nodded within a hundred of what Crip had he declared We know Penny spent some and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on
Handing the money over Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful Shall we get out of here
Leaving the card room they moved back through the Palace the way they had come Glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt to halt them Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street
Neither spoke till they reached their horses Pat paused there looking across at the young fellow be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it Russ He started to return it
To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand Not me he ruled decidedly had enough It was you that tracked it down anyway Stevens he pursued strictly shove along home
Whatever you say Pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed his brows puckered You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you really he observed mildly
Old Crip retorted Cobb tartly know when you tell him But I want this to sink in awhile Then maybe next time he be so quick on the trigger
Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs the doctor he returned with a smile But I still think an awful nice girl Russ
You have to tell me flashed Cobb Giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street Pat let him go following more leisurely At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler
The truth was the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck always glad to see me over there he mused bleakly Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle
Over and above that however was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events Gyp Carmer have known about Colcord's money unless he was told and who else would have told him He asked himself the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money
How much of an accident could that be
Nearing home he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot but on the range gunfire had a meaning Hauling up Russ listened carefully Two minutes later it came again a double explosion followed by a third sounding more distant
As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house He tightened up in a twinkling So far as he knew only his father could be there What did it mean Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm
His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing Still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed Setting a course straight for the house he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face
When it was followed by a second whining even closer Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression He knew now what he was up against Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and having spotted his approach was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight
Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested he had his answer a moment later
Over this way He gone far A harsh cry floated to him across the brush
A carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close Dismounting Russ looked about hastily Toward the west this depression led toward a draw Leading his pony he hurried that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range
Swinging up then and bending forward over the horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind He had been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away A second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm Another snarled close overhead
Jumping Jerusalem get out of here
At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless Sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment He heard cries from behind him but he could make out no words
He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw and made it Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed Gradually the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range Yet he must chance it He clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt flying behind him and flashed a look about

Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks on the combat record Every plane that could fly was sent into the air
Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships Greg himself took two flights with Todman leading the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs
A weapons carrier took Greg Todman Belton Banjo Ferguson and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes No one had much to say The sky glowered down at them There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever
The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure
got her as neat as I can Donovan said as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders But this goddamn climate for carabao not airplanes
make out you worry chief Greg replied wondering if he himself believed it
Yeah See you Donovan said as he jumped off the wing The expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return At the prearranged time Greg started the engine and taxied out From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip He wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission Yet long before the scheduled time for return Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky
Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan
Greg's mission was the last to leave and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again To the west the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it He possessed the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory He shivered in the warm cockpit
The overcast was solid above him As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it close in before they returned
Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle Todman try to go under this stuff Stay in close and go up the valley
Roger Sweeney Todman called back and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg
Greg took the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf He dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain
The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn It was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in If the other pilots were worried they did not show it The formation remained perfect
When the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if the sun had come out He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity
Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him Somebody beat us to it Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation
Visibility continued to be limited and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet It was frustrating His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill But Greg's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn
Finally as time began to run out he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies The low clouds made bombing difficult There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run The accuracy was deplorable One of Greg's bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle
With their load of bombs gone the planes moved swiftly and easily Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home Mercifully it was still open Like a man making a deep dive Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman's voice broke in Sweeneys Three bogies Twelve o'clock level
Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel He saw them specks against the gray but closing fast They were headed straight for each other on a collision course Friend or enemy The same old question And only a few seconds to answer it
Zeros Todman said excitedly and hopefully
And then he thought Todman might be right His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification He narrowed the shape down to two either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft
If it were the enemy tactically his position was correct Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability American on speed and firepower His present maximum altitude up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was the enemy and he been spotted already But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course
In seconds Greg made his decision
He pushed the radio button Sweeney Blue hit the deck Lots of throttle Todman you take the one on the left take the middle Belton the one on the right If Japs make sure first Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two Rogers
The planes light with most of the gas burned out responded beautifully Greg's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees The opposing aircraft continued to come on They appeared to be the enemy Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes There was of course no way for the other planes to get by them It was a box But they could turn and escape to the east
Greg pushed the radio button again Todman drop your second element back If any of us miss they can pick up the pieces Now make sure Japs
Even as he said it Greg knew they had found the enemy The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom
Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him His hands shook Arm your guns Sweeneys
Japs Japs came a high-pitched voice
Greg to Sweeney Blue One pass only No turns bust your ass in this canyon an order
He moved the flights over against one wall It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery If the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done
Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM and the engine responded as if it had been waiting The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around They seen us Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise They seen us He hit the radio button Now Sweeneys now take 'em home
He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag Out of the corner of his eye he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him Perfect he thought
With the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be done Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board
He tightened his turn His nose up It was going to be dangerous Eight aircraft in this small box Please dear God make my pilots good he prayed
He took a lead on the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another The enemy did not veer It did not seem possible that they been spotted Blind fools
Now
Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger The plane rumbled and slowed Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered Luck was with him His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces A large piece of engine cowling vanished It was all Greg had time to see His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast almost inverted and heading up into the clouds His speed was dropping rapidly If he spun out now he would join his opponent on the ground
Wingman stay clear he prayed He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back He fought the panic of vertigo He had no idea which was up and which was down He held the controls where they had been Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out

Over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles Cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat
Moriarty my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced
We were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop
Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican Moriarty New Mexico
Gracias Adios I said exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass Then I saw the father's head slightly turn gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold
Autos whizzed past White-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze
Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumbing hopefully I saw emergent in windshield flash red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension despair the leering face of old Herry
Mor-ee-air-teeeee he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde
Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where hidden more delicately-textured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes
Damn his luck I would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and Well at least I have shouted back a taunt
Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me It was stopping
Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag I heard Sahjunt Yoorick meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck The voice was that of Johnson tail gunner off another crew
Squeezing a look between Johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired Y'all drahve
I nodded
Onleh one thiihng Mrs. Roebuck continued goin nawth mah husbun in Sante Fe an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it make no diffrunce
I said that it make any difference to me either as far as I knew
How far I knew will shortly become apparent Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit 35 m.p.h. is still in ee-faket
I let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the 60 m.p.h. which would I hoped overhaul Herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe
When Johnson ejaculated Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola Ma'am Mrs. Roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh a little younguh than you bawhs
Johnson never would have believed she had a son that age Mrs. Roebuck thought Johnson was a sweet bawh lahk thet but her Herman was getting to be a man there was no getting around it Just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh Major Roebuck an Ah an Huhmun says May Ah hev one too Just as p'lite an an cohnfidunt an Ah says Uh coahse you but he says Whah nawt you ah hevin one An Ah ansuh him an so Ah said Aw right Ah gay-ess an his fathuh uttuh one wohd an aftuh Huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn mah back an Ah think nahce at all
No I Johnson said a good Baptist and drinking
Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would she said lead us to Taos and then Raton and eventshahleh out of New Mexico How lightly her eventshah-leh passed into the crannies where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word would echo And re-echo
Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck father or grandfather of Senor Moriarty's Ford sedan came screeching to a dust-swirling stop and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window
Get in buddies Get in The straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back
Johnson unwired the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped fragments of glass and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer
In back buddy the driver said to me
Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack I stepped on the running board it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin The truck was hurtling forward I seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag and merely wrecking my camera I was to discover later my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and but this is no medical report
I was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all Whatever satisfaction that might offer
Something pulled my leg
I drew back drawing back my foot for a kick But it was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck cab's glassless rear window The way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear
beer
Hell yes I roared back between dusty lips Did I want a beer Did an anteater want ants
Bueno amigo Gracias I hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary
At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish but the driver's white teeth flashing at me the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing I have known the difference
Johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it White teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear
We were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards We were in a field in a tight screeching turn Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down When I fell on my back I saw a vulture hovering
Just as I got to my knees there was again the sound of the fence stretching and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously This time no wire came whipping into the truck
We were back on the road I regained my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window Johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers
Tee-wah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing That was Tee-wah I was talking You thought I was a Mexican you buddy
I nodded
Hell all right buddy the Indian I now guessed said Drink your beer
Miraculously the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my luckily waterproof watch No sooner had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck The beer foamed furiously I drank furiously A long time Emptied the bottle
Teeth again flashing back at me the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which amigo appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound I bobbed my head each time it appeared
Suddenly the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs
A big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning Beyond it the gray road stretched a long long way The car was just about to us its driver's fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in Sante Fe on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue
I tossed the bottle High so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof Too high On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash
Aye-yah-ah-ah
The Indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief probably only a fraction of Johnson's the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips
Another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board a dirt clod anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle
We were slowing In the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleaming But Johnson quickly unwire the truck door and if I escaped he might suffer
The car was approaching fast On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket There was no time to pick out a penny I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile
There was a blur just under my focus of vision a crash the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center
I heard the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me Looking back I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number
S-s-sahjunt Johnson's fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab and that self-proclaimed Baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own lips
Two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing The Indian's arm whipped sidewise there was a flash of amber and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car
Brakes shrieked behind us I saw Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window
Drink you son of a bitch I quickly turned around and began to drink But the Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson

I guided her to the divan turned off the TV faced her She sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes And what eyes they were Big and dark a melting golden brown Eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled Plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them It was a disturbingly familiar face too but I remember where we had met
I said Do we know each other Miss
No I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all I could think of was This time she stopped the rush of words herself sorry Shall I go on She smiled It was her first smile But worth waiting for
Sure I said But one word at a time O.K. She was still hugging the stained coat around her so I said Relax let me take your things Would you like a drink or coffee
No thanks She stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out She was wearing nothing beneath the coat She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again but not soon enough There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and now I was certain seen her somewhere before
I forgot She yelped Oh do forgive me sorry
I forgive
what started all the trouble in the first place Oh dear all unstrung
You and me both dear we I seen you I mean surely
You may have seen me on TV she said done several filmed commercials for
Then it hit me Zing I cried
Why yes And you recognized me
Yes indeed In fact I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell Man you rang it was in color too Miss and Miss your name anyway Ah you were splendid I sat by her on the divan Splendid In a waterfall and all that
the last one we did That was a fun one
bet It was fun for me all right I mean to pry but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles I mean Is advertising honest
It depends on who does it I never wear anything at all It seem fair somehow
I agree with you more
I really do have something important to tell you Mr. Scott About the murder
Murder Oh yeah I said Tell me about the murder
She told me Zing was the creation of two men Louis Thor and Bill Blake partners in zing Inc. peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when with the addition of SX-21 to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign sales had soared practically into orbit Their product had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping the A.M.A. and the Veterinary Journal among other repositories of higher wisdom and before much longer if you have a cake of their soap in the john even your best friends would think you bathe
My lovely caller Joyce Holland was her name had previously done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth a super production had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor The water in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick foamy soapsuds fashioned of course from zing Joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled The finished and drastically cut product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap even to clean men and boys
Joyce went on When finished Lou Mr. Thor asked me to stay a little longer He wanted a few stills for magazine ads he said Everybody left and I stayed in the pool then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too And he have any clothes on
He
Yes he Did I mean She paused Did leap into the pool and have anything on Anyway it was evident what he had in mind
You got away you
Yes He caught up with me once and grabbed me but I was all covered with zing very slippery you know
I know I have the stuff in the house But pleased to hear
So I just scooted out of his clutches I swam like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car The keys were still in it and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where changed
driven around for a while Joyce said then thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive parked in front and walked toward the pool While several yards from it still concealed by the shrubbery seen two men on her left at the pool's edge She went on
A man was holding onto Lou holding him up Maybe Lou was only unconscious but right then I thought he must be dead The man shoved him into the water then ran past the cabana a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive I was so scared well I just ran to my car and came here
You know who the other man was
No I never did see his face I get a good look at him at all his back was to me and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit But sure the other one was Lou
What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and do whatever detectives do and get her clothes and handbag containing her identification She realized have to notify the police but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name
Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series Underwater Western Eye a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife Mrs. Oatnut Grits Or at least not to Joyce
And I so want the part she said The commercials have just been for money there been any real incentive for me to do them but in Underwater Western Eye have a chance to act I could show what I can do
As far as I was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what she could do But I promised Joyce I would mention her name if at all only as a last resort Seeming much relieved she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles and I smiled all the way into the bedroom There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness slipped my coat on and went back into the front room
Joyce squirmed a little on the divan starting to itch she said
Itch
Yes still all covered with that soap I was loaded with suds when I ran away and I had a chance to wash it off Mmmm it sure itches
You might as well wait here while gone so you can use my shower if like
Oh love to I showed her the shower and tub and she said smiling If you really mind I think get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your tub That always relaxes me it you
Only when I do it I shook my head One of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color Soak as long as you want Joyce probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you So have everything all to yourself doggone
I looked at my watch Ten after nine Time to go I supposed Well goodbye I said
Goodbye better hurry
Oh you can count on that
She smiled slightly Softly Warmly hurry too much be soaking for at least half an hour
That was all she said But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them However when a job to be done a monstrosity of grim determination I like to think I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door As I went out I could hear water pouring in the shower Hot water She be taking a cold shower Hell she
Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan and it took me less than five minutes to get there But the scene was not the quiet calm scene expected Four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool Two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather A few yards beyond the group of men a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra
Lieutenant Rawlins one of the plain-clothesmen spotted me and said Hi Shell and walked toward me you hear about this one I grinned but ignored the question He push it Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and been friends for years
He filled me in A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that 10 minutes ago now Present at the scene in addition to the dead man who was indeed Louis Thor had been Thor's partner Bill Blake and Antony Rose an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account Neither of them I understood had been present at the filming session earlier
What were they doing here I asked Rawlins
They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff
Yeah heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately What is the gunk
How would I know a secret That was the new advertising angle something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient Actually only two men know what the formula is Blake and He stopped and looked at Thor's body
I said O.K. so now only Blake knows it strike you foul or fair
say yet Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em The PM might show he drowned instead but what the once-over-lightly gives us Accident murder suicide take your pick
pick murder Anything else
According to Rose he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out

Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living this is not so for education offers all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do and now I understand why they are classics those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick
I worked for my Uncle an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre the old French Quarter The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting
I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted
The arrangement turned out to be excellent I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide joyous celebration with romance in the air and when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring
My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither of us said anything One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt They were married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty She looked more like twenty-five or six It was really a May and December combination
My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex There was something about the contour of her face her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me Her legs were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect
You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist accustomed to studying the physical body The true artist is like one of those scientists who from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body The artist looks at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind's eye the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store
That she impressed me instantly was obvious I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks True she was my Aunt married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps I did not know or much care
She was standing with her back to the glass door Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired As it is in so many affairs of the heart a man and a woman meet and something clicks Something clicked in this instance but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it for we both kept our distance
When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it And then I became aware that she too glanced at me surreptitiously I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of Me too You have probably experienced this It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity
Why she married him I do not know I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living Perhaps with my Uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father some women with father fixations do
For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home his bride opened the store I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights The cavernous depth cluttered with antiques echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk She placed her palms fingers outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say Now what next
I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour I was standing beside her watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped
I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush Her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts was warm and moist and tender I heard her murmur better lock the door
It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch
When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said
He will not always be indisposed
I know I was thinking about that How will we work it out
I know she said the man You figure it out noticed the way been looking at me ever since we met
I guess we both felt it I said
I guess so she said
But now what
Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable
I know what we can do I said Tell him I made a pass at you
She raised a protesting hand with a startled air
What are you trying to do Get thrown out If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew and not even a blood nephew
I want to be thrown out and I think I will I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us
By telling him you are making passes at me She said incredulously
When I was in college I grinned I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class I even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball There will be romance and flirtation If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did so instead of just telling him I made a pass say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead You are both the same size He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it
But you she began
worry about me It will turn out all right
I understand she insisted Are you trying to cut your throat
No I chuckled just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education
As we expected on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning I felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife
I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner I must say the figure was well made up If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain I suspected why he brought it along
In the half darkness I approached cautiously making sure he did not see me He was looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without wasting words I smacked him hard across the face
You cheap bitch I exclaimed You cheap no good two-timing bitch You get a good loyal husband smack and you fall for a pass by his own nephew You should smack be ashamed of yourself

He had better write a postcard to Walter He opened the myth book again and there along the margin next to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips were the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's address The bars were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer The code which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith and that might be good for something Nicolas called on his muse a line came back
Squaresville man and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts
That ought to draw a laugh Nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind
And indeed his postcard did draw from Walter a letter recommending his friend the poet Nicolas Manas to his friend Meredith Wilder Five days later on receiving it Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table Dammit He inwardly cried
His hand was large and square and heavily tanned The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months He had returned to the pension a week ago Now he was just in the late poems of Holderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him plus next semester's class preparation He was determined to spend an industrious summer Well maybe Manas call Meredith's fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him Sie lacheln die Schwarzen Hexen The menace of Manas gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it How the dark fates laughed Or more rhythmically The swarthy witches are laughing And he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas Manas
But Nicolas too was being interrupted that morning
Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him Should she wake him She have the heart Her heart her maternal feeling in fact her being was too busy expressing itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket in a park like a scene from Poussin She was just not able to break the spell Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars Nicolas Look Nicolas go to bed with boys no sex see So if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money Ballet dancer Protests tears and take what you want Nicolas I am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful To this meek conjugation Nicolas had replied O.K. I can use this blanket And when you get off this job tonight well you can something to eat And as a matter of fact Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew He had always known how to find a bed and on his own terms He used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth This was surely a reunion in art it was all that poetry promised
That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes His advice his voice saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair this was all new Her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse of a new faith
The next day he was gone
Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most determined Even so it took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's whereabouts Packing a small suitcase informing her husband whom she found in Harry's Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a drink getting on the train all this had only taken her two hours She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens Dear girl Walter had finally said he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens How like him Mary Jane had smilingly said His address Walter added is that great foundling home the American Express And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband For the last half hour Mary Jane had criss-crossed half the length of the Gardens and at last come upon her knight His presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels
She set down her suitcase Should she wake him No Smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched
The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car He began sweating In his dream he cried Slow down for Chrissake He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass His nose was tickled He sneezed He blew his nose expertly between his fingers He spit He half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then more vigorously between his legs He belched he stretched
Mary Jane got up quietly and walked away
Twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the Grafin's pension her tears dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath
Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities She had retreated to this world The Grafin who was charmed by her told her Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair Families are very interesting Nevertheless there is no bath But a young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once And then we shall see The Grafin was partial to the word shall
Meredith was irritated when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him She is a great beauty Shall we allow her not to have a bath Actually she is a sad beauty I believe You shall see her at dinner Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running when it stopped he began busily typing sitting up in a virtuous way Before dinner he shaved for the second time that day A thing he did not like doing generally Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan He flexed his muscles for several minutes got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed
In the small gallery used as the guests' dining room Meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets she also served as maid when he saw the Grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table It would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin so startled was he by Mary Jane's beauty Yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the Grafin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special Mary Jane had made very little effort Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no brassiere beneath Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders Perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day She had touched her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual The result was grace and modesty As she was rather tired this evening her simple Thank you for the use of your bath when she sat down opposite him spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control Meredith began falling in love
Soup Only this morning veal cutlets Oh I possibly eat all this
Wine Then you were typing poems this afternoon
Fruit compote If you think I would understand it a smile
What a beautiful room Like as if it were built of books
Having opened the windows onto the terrace lit the fire translated the motto Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin Opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it I think the maids tipple in the afternoon
Those sweet girls Oh joking It tastes a little like poppyseed its name Steinhager She whispered Steinhager to herself several times memorizing it Would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself Meredith's voice was always deep with rough bass notes in it in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. Poetry Center nights his voice was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy His new poem a love poem told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed The husband points the steps out with his flashlight Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line or was it the fire But he read on In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go on In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face still blind Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters counters pots and pans Waiting below stairs in her mind Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words Oh that myth about Orpheus and What is her name I can never pronounce it She repeated Eurydice The third time rather urgently But with her hand poem again She raised her face and nodded sweet and very sad They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds They finished the small bottle of Steinhager She confessed she was unhappy he asked was it her husband She began to explain There was this poet in Italy He interrupted Please judge all poets They smiled
At her door two or three hours later Mary Jane whispered Everyone is asleep Kissing her he whispered several times Eurydice The third time rather urgently But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth

They were west of the Sabine but only God knew where
For three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze
Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen Hoa-whup He commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips
He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face He spat The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches
He cleared his throat and wet his lips As cheerfully as possible he said Well I guess we could all do with a little drink
He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste But it was water Thank the Lord they still had water
He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity He took a long but carefully controlled draught He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck She took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his
She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face She set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully
What happens when no more water She asked smolderingly
She was like charcoal he thought dark opaque explosive Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up And all the time she had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its under side but not visibly
A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice
There must be some water under there He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river We can get it if we dig he said patiently
And add fever to our troubles She scoffed Or do you want to see if I can stand fever too
We can boil it he said
Her chin sharpened lost and burning up already she bit out tensely The tires are rattling on the wheels now roll off in another day There was no valley like this on your map You even know where headed
Hettie he said as gently as he could still headed west Somewhere hit a trail
Somewhere She repeated Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves
His wide mouth compressed In a way he blame her He had picked out this pathless trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on their honeymoon
It had been a mistake but anything would have been a mistake as it turned out It the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her She had hated the whole idea before they started Actually she had hated him before she ever saw him It had been five days too late before he learned that gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum administered by her mother
The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder He had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time But each mile westward she had hated him the deeper
He stared at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands I suppose he muttered I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement
try to be noble Her laugh was hard They have sold me in the first place if been food enough to go around
He winced Hettie they sell you he said miserably They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just inside of them Without money or property what would you have had at Baton Rouge
I might have starved but at least I be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt
He darkened under his heavy burn His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead
To his puzzlement there suddenly was no haze The valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead
Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them heavy ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills He had never seen clouds like them before but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina
He hollered hoarsely Hang on And goaded the oxen as he yelled He wanted to turn them putting the wagon against the storm Too late he realized that in turning he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a grade or ridge
He swung up over the wheel You had better get inside he warned her
But she sat on in stubborn silence
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel Frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake
Their world turned black It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence The heavens opened pelting them with hail the size of walnuts And then came the water not rain but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods Through the splash of the rising waters they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing big chunks out of the banks
The jetting frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising They cringed under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom
The cloudburst cut off abruptly They were engulfed by the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river Then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright sunlight
Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills The water level was higher than their hubs Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored
There was no real sign of the river now just a roiling oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon Now and then the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past
The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging her shoulders and still trembling Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben
Out of compulsion to say something cheery Ben Prime blurted Well we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit At least the wheels dug in The soaking will put life back in the wagon too
His wife give a sign heard She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current Somebody was riding the tree It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting astride an upright branch
She did not call out But as the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend It speared up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned slowly The pale blob of the woman disappeared
the one lucky The girl murmured harshly
Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray and crimson Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they needed his
It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water
He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward They were already swollen to bursting Of all their worldly belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been the most treasured It was spoiled now for seed and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it The oxen might as well enjoy it
He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished The waters lay muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding
He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills that rimmed the valley A terrible numbing sense of futility swept over him
He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen The spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece
Hope surged within him He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie then stopped barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate Still he felt better A tight wagon meant so much
He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort Their jams and jellies had not suffered He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save Now he broke them open hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie
His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and wagon open
He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk holding her meager treasures He said hesitantly Hettie I figure your things got wet too much a good trunk If you want to get them aired
She said without turning her head After that rain beating in atop the dust there a thing that be streaked
He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs

Sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze Now roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do
The lifeboats were stuck fast We budge them I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters
One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No. 3 which trembled violently in the davits Brassnose yelled Come on Sommers Max step on it we got a chance now Heave on those ropes the come unstuck
We pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until they bled profusely The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water
Brassnose Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat get away fast said Brassnose shaking water from his mop of bleached hair That tub is going to explode all at once
Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke Dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we go back into that inferno
Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water Sommers you bale while we row Brassnose commanded
As best as I could determine we were some 700 miles west of New Guinea in the Bismark Archipelago Three days previously we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands our muscles were hot wires of pain
Brassnose was strangely silent The big man with the whitened hair murmured something his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue which I recognized having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 class at the University of Chicago
He then said something which struck a chord in my memory
God help us if near the island of Eromonga be in real trouble then rather keep bailing or sink
I was puzzled by the remark then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies He had been speaking of this archipelago
Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War 1 Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth The place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century stone age amazons who live in an all-female matriarchal society which is self-sufficient
I remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate Bobby Pauson But how do they reproduce Dr. Griggs sure that males have something to do with that process
There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly I see your point Pauson Of course males play a role there but believe me when I say you enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga Indeed you live long for the females either drive the men seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods In fact one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men
I think I know what you mean Brassnose I said I know something about Eromonga hope we come to a safer place
But we Three hours later while we were bailing desperately a dot of land came into view Foster Lukuklu Frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil
A half-hour passed we had drifted closer In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own the big bo'sun's mate quavered
Tchalo It is Eromonga look hard you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff
I squinted at the looming shoreline There was a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs A fine example of engineering in a primitive society
What is the scaffolding for Brassnose
He made a sound of despair deep in his throat It was embarrassing to see strapping blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen
Aaa-ee It is their tultul the jumping platform of death It is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male is worthy of survival there Often I heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers
Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft
I expected Brassnose as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood to speak to them But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked
So I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect and said We greet you in peace In ngandlu My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire We are thirsty and hungry our sore and burned hands and arms need attention
The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair
She said My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen You are welcome to Eromonga My people await you on the shore You shall have food water and rest
Thirty minutes later the outrigger grated on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there
I looked All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick Some had been there for years others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them
There was one object which sickened yet fascinated me This was also a corpse a male judging from the coral arm bands the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose
The body may have been two or three weeks' dead I looked with revulsion at the legs They were shattered Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh The man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul
As if divining my thoughts the girl Songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden
This is our tultul a jumping platform aku Later you shall know it better Is it not well-made Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one which is higher and stronger than the old one We are very proud of it
You have every right to be I replied gravely in the Manu dialect but my attention was fixed on Brassnose the biggest and strongest of us He looked as if he was going to keel over I felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it do to show these girls that we were afraid Not so soon anyway
I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily hoping it would make an impression on the women This one is the maku Frayne He speaks your language too for he is the grandson of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning The maku Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather
This was the worst thing I could have said Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly Sommers you meddling Yank a fool They despise males who brag of their strength they destroy such men with their damned tests ruined me blast you
At first I thought he was out of his head talking wildly like this But a glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out
The women's faces had hardened after my statement At a nod from Songau four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived
Besides terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality and will My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
In the Manu tongue eromonga means manhood a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed In the hut to which I was assigned Max had his own quarters my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases
Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things For an anthropologist loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951
From L'Turu I heard that until about 1850 the people of this island which was about the size of Guam or smaller had been of both sexes and that the normal family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations
But in the middle of the last century an island woman named Karipo seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled Miraculously Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable loss of life on both sides
Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist She quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death Within a decade or less few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up
Karipo was great goddess told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children the crone told me All men went away from here Those who stayed had to pass tests Few passed She cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth Karipo's women then named this place Eromonga manhood for just the strongest men could stay here Come I show you
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood In the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground

I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized then headed for home Maybe to beat up on his squaw Benson looked up and saw Ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack
like to know just which it is that those guys understand the liquor or automobiles Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened Maybe the Indian too much at fault Ramey thought Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any of us Anyway he deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at
Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement Benny He said to his partner
You mean dream
Not exactly Just see it Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble
Nope just you all the time sometimes I think the only way ever get a decent partner
Ramey smiled but he thought to himself I always see me too Never Benny Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think With this realization sometimes he saw himself as he looked down
You seen him yet Benson said referring to the Indian
He in the car Ramey said
You go clear around Benson said If you want to see something back on the other side by the trunk of the car
Too long a waiting line Ramey answered pretending to joke
A few minutes later the insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane Horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to look like a tourist It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head
The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear
When they were ready to leave Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer
a body you mind looking at Benson said and they stopped She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt Slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn straight back simply
What outfit does she drive for Benson said
Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey a recognition She might have been someone he had once loved He had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run The truck routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay How would you ever see her again The feeling subsided it was only a small yearning Their work was lonely
she doing in this bunch Benson said and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been
The girl looked around at the countryside Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on She began to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but Benson knew what it was The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real said You want to go around there Ma'am The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her
The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car The two drivers moved closer
What does he want a spoon Benson said to Ramey
One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still inside
The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes He was very tanned big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster
dead he The man said He turned and bent over the body of the Indian There was nothing in particular on the man's face It was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine
this The man said backing up a step still looking down His words were mostly to himself
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement
But what is it The man said with a tone of impatience
But what is it The man had spoken only once Ramey heard the words again inside weakened the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears
The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin He stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees do that fella brains
The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth It was a straight solid once-in-a-lifetime shot he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin Ramey's fist and the air expelled from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together
The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand As he watched the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet He done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard
With a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out in front of him His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth was slightly open After what seemed several seconds the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth He moaned and pulled the hand away Even yet there was no realization in his eyes
Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him He did not look around
What happened Someone said
hurt A woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from the man's wife The man on the ground began to move one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him Blood dripped down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color
The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back Can you hear can you talk to me She begged An incoherent puzzled sound came from the red mouth The girl looked around quickly at several of the people None of the crowd had stepped forward to help Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment
Why did you do it why did you hit him She said her voice rising Ramey said nothing A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again
Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers No one seemed to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver beyond finding out
Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman Benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol
All right step back The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him
You all right
Mough my mough the man said trying to talk without moving his lips His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it

Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute The body continued to lash but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome bloody mass out of the bungalow He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots He heard their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes
It was only then that he turned to look at Penny
She was sitting on the edge of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found her The fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth
But her hands were calm now got guts thought Keith got more guts than any other woman in the world
Keith said Penny Keith you were wonderful I suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life but I am Thank you Keith
He smiled at her sincerity And for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty Strange Seven years been married He knew her mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part But her beauty always surprised him anew
I realize that this is hardly the time to say it Penny said Keith But knowing you I know that glad to be alive and grateful and sorry because I killed the snake even though I had to that so
Penny lowered her eyes
Yes she said almost in a whisper as if admitting to a crime
The snake was beautiful it Asked Keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself as he struggled to control his growing anger It was a king cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle it it
Penny did not answer Now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him
all God's creatures we Keith was snarling now All of us every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle You love this village and these stinking brown people because God's creatures too And you love Ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even a little more because a beautiful man And he loves you because a beautiful woman all God's creatures we Penny All of us that is except me You hate me you hate my guts because I like to hunt You actually hate me and we both know it because I killed that filthy snake Well why you say something
Penny would not rise to his mood
There anything left to say is there Keith
She softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader He knew she was not sulking not even angry at him Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him
The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet For a brief period each year the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long meandering journey to the sea running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam past the Khasi Hills and into Bengal past Sirinjani and Madaripur until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal
Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space But Keith looked down more than up He thought of the jungles below him and of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals the lords
At first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war But after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to a man paradoxically who might even survive He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates The RAF was Britain's weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war
He knew how to shoot down Nazis And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it because he was chemically incapable of fear That was true but only half the truth The other half he like to recognize even to himself He enjoyed the killing Not defending England or being an ace or fighting for humanity He enjoyed killing And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi
Nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish The Nazis bombed Britain so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down Not quite It was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis who were better organized and technically superior It took a long time before the British tipped the balance
Keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be risked They grounded him over his protests not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the Command offices
That was where he met Penny
He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the Command offices but that was all Penny knew him better on her part He had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals They go for bull-like muscle as a rule He had strength in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier He was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep
His hair was black already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only one permitted to a man The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles and Penny hating the cliche had to admit that in this case it applied Keith was an eagle
Penny and Keith had no romance No dates or hand-holding But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly
The Command offices were in the border country up north where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy The Nazis knew this of course and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit
This time they had been lucky The Command post was underground and well camouflaged But there been enough time to build it for keeps There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a direct hit comes along
This one was actually more of a near miss The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post but not precisely into the Command room itself There was a shattering cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust and flying debris and everyone in the room men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered
That is everyone but Keith and Penny
They stood there just the two of them in the rocking shattering blast Keith was on his feet because he care at all about life any more Penny on her feet proudly because she cared too much
The bomb was a solitary one The blast damaged but did not destroy the room Keith's eyes met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction And as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his
The chaplain married them on the next day
After the war Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her She came from Ohio from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers But to Keith's London-bred mind such acreage sounded rather invincible It that however which decided them not to go to America Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the jungles He tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself He stop killing That was his true love not Penny The terrible power of a gun the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never wanted to lose And in the hunting land this hunger was considered to be a noble thing
When they got to Shillong in Assam he was happy This is a paradise for hunters This was the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread The great black leopards The sambur buck the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk He even hunted elephant although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin But there are big rogues in both countries These were the ones Keith sought out the loners the ones who killed for the joy of it like himself
He and Penny would go out on tame elephants raised from babyhood in the keddah And while he was ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools Peacocks strutted across their path preening There were fantastic flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes and grunted derision when they consider such game worthy of a shot from the

Now the next morning they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms with the weighted line beside it and Robinson Roy who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive was already back on the surface
He and his safety man Herr Schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first Robinson clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank assembly He was frowning He took his mask from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck
Temper temper Mrs. Forsythe said laughing uneasily A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was not yet ten A.M.
I loused it Rob said with a savage note in his voice All I have to do to set the record is to go on down So instead I come up
Was it my equipment The German asked Was it something went bad with the breathing
The equipment was fine Rob stated standing up He was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation He stared stonily at the floor I was down to 275 been that far half a dozen times I get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick
Well I get it Artie said still on the ladder You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself So you turn around
No it that Rob said A note of awe came into his voice When I came up damnit I thought I was going down I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening
Pressure-happy Artie said and climbed in
right Robinson said I was expecting it sure But when it happens to you like that I tell you and a hundred feet from where you thought you were well it makes you think You head back down again Not me anyway Not right away He had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him
Waddell the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat Now he was going to show how much he knew Our boy chicken out no sir He ran into the rapture of the depths Nitrogen narcosis It makes the diver feel drunk
Well the only way to be Mrs. Forsythe said and gave her brassy laugh
Maybe not if 200 feet under water Artie said
Anyway Waddell went on nothing to fool with It can kill you Personally I blame him for giving up the dive much as I regret losing the story
giving anything up Robinson said He stood there towering over them all gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group and yet like a child among adults You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride going down again
my boy Mr. Forsythe exclaimed not going to give up as easy as all that He was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of Commodore was never used without irony Old Commodore Forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again Rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride
Why he went on when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip I think twice about it helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop Hell I gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven how many years ago was it Rob
Seven years ago Commodore Rob said impassively He was thinking big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started Excuse me he said abruptly He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him
When you go you go Mrs. Forsythe said
Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley
Hi there Schaffner he had said Can I make you one
No thank you very much Schaffner had answered in his accented English I do not drink so much thank you
Waddell had looked the man over trying to size him up He was in his early forties rather short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps and he said to himself hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night Aloud he had said making conversation
Rob tells me using your Atlantis equipment on the dive
Yes Herr Schaffner had said
one hell of a decent boy I like that kid
I agree yes
And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country is that right
Well no Herr Schaffner said
Waddell turned to face him No He asked But what he told me Why his main reason for making the dive
Shaffner looked at him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a little spreading gesture with his two hands
What do you mean Waddell asked frowning
Please let me explain the German said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year Now I wish to enter the American market where the competition is very strong I must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products With all respect to a fine young man Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries
Waddell was not an eminently moral person but he did not like what he had just heard Did you tell him all this He asked
Perhaps not in so many words the German said But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy Never never did I offer him the exclusive rights We spoke of the need for advertising and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity He was most eager to make the dive of course I was willing But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements
Well damn Waddell said There was the end of his front-page feature story with byline He started out the door
One moment Herr Schaffner said You intend to speak with Mr. Roy
What else Waddell asked
If you will pardon I think it would be better if not Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive Whatever you tell him he will dive I know this from my talks with him
Well let him make up his own mind OK Waddell said On the basis of the facts
You will make him unhappy and anxious the German said At 200 300 400 feet under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will be thinking about what you are telling him It is not good Mr. Waddell you will do him great harm
There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk
I am an honest man the German said with fervor I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive I will make him distributor for all of Florida a big market All tourists come to Florida This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop Yes But there is no use causing him to worry at this time
The German's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty He took a big swig of his drink It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this I think maybe right Schaffner he said He has the distributorship for Florida you say
Yes the German said At least for South Florida
By God Waddell said we want to upset the boy at this time of all times I guess right He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps The story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving the unknown the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America Join me in another He had asked
Thank you the German had said courteously I do not drink so much
Now in that same cabin Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper
Blessed Saint Nicholas I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered And when I make the dive again He paused crossed himself said a Hail Mary slowly and with understanding Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck he took his appeal direct to Headquarters Holy Mary Mother of God Star of the Sea stay Thou with me on this next dive Make it come off all right Let me set the record this time and let me get back OK so the German will give me the exclusive And make my life different and better from this time on Amen
He crossed himself again and rose He felt a good deal less shaky As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie who came in and sat down on a bunk Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger He waited awhile before he said Roy you know your decompression table you
You know I know it Robinson answered warily
You came straight up from 275 without a stop Artie said
Well I was a little bit confused Anyway I down long enough to matter You see me stretched out on the deck do you
You know what they say about two deep dives in one day Artie went on still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently I think you should go down again

Early that day Matsuo saw a marine The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot then fled without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery As his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed
In the leafiest part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over the meadow For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come hunting
His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure Yesterday today tomorrow no surrender His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace only a faint chill of doubt He murmured to himself with firmness No surrender It was best to die fighting the marines His superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor
What if the marines never came His comrades were all dead He had no rice Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide
Whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife The knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth
As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing Gloom receded
The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though debating whether to brave the sunlight His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist
Come out come out in the meadow Matsuo said under his breath
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face A signal Matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness
Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills They had fought from caves and the marines resorted to burning them out Even now like a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his uniform blazing The marines let him advance When he sank on his knees they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy
Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching while stacking bodies Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle reeking of death
Apprehensively he peered to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with the one left to distract him He strained his hearing Cautious feet stepping on leafmold faint creaking of belts and slings whispers he heard none of these Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird Because he hear them he was more convinced they were there
A spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground leaning sidewise on a tree trunk he embraced it Humiliation made Matsuo tremble While his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver Taking aim at the man's face Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the head
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound Hush followed Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle How stupid to give his position away
The jungle did not retort The sitter remained seated hugging the tree Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy and insects hummed and birds occasionally called Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke
Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing his hands over his eyes He went into a whirling dance a sort of blind chasing of the tail It ended when he tumbled but jumping right up he staggered in no particular direction He wore no head cover of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon
With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop When he got closer to the tree Matsuo noted the wild look on his face The pockets of his jacket bulged Hand grenades
The bobbing head was a poor target so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk
The marine spun clapping a hand high on his chest and dived forward In the hush that followed the echoes Matsuo was tense They could come on him now without difficulty Gradually he reached a conclusion The marine was alone for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree
Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out Reflex
Rifle leveled on the man he made a rush Heat in the sunlight pressed in like an invisible crowd
He squatted by the head gently placing the rifle on the ground With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back He was bearded The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone around the hole blood glistened in a little patch Maintaining his clutch on the hair Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets In one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter both sticky from the man's bleeding In the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief One by one he tossed the objects aside He smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter he had no use any longer for exact time even had the watch been running Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief
Too bad the marine had no water From its holder he took his own canteen The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure The marine's eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted in the glare
So alive Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips The marine reached up a hand Matsuo shook his head None for you The marine blinked soon dropping his hand Not only had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on You came well equipped to die
Some odor made him lean over the man He sniffed and recognized it Sake So that had been his difficulty Drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his bivouac
The marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned When he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over Be a good turtle
Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts In the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of sake
The marine shut his eyes Are you a thrower of flame marine Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows He waited in his squat gripping the hair
Every so often he turned the knife Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle He must have saturated himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze Matsuo shook his head Strange
At last he reached for the knife Even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes The marine yelled and flung the hand away With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek A shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat burned the other cheek burned each hand when they came groping again The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment
Matsuo stood up A small measure of payment marine He dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the rifle behind a shoulder
The marine hands on cheeks rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach He ceased weeping
Matsuo walked toward his tree once glancing back The marine was still He would soon die
As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow What now In the jungle birds were mute while insects preserved only the monotony of living
Someone called It was the marine head lifted he strained and called Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat He cupped his mouth and yelled Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder Once and for all finish this marine who would not die He aimed but listened It sounded as if the man were calling him Hey Japanese hey there Japanese The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container He performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct
Sake Matsuo called
The marine nodded vigorously
Matsuo laughed slung the rifle The marine was a winehead His superiors had said that all marines were depraved
The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol Remembering his own thirst Matsuo took out his water bottle One swallow was all he would have he was very thirsty but he must observe water discipline His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline
He began to uncap the bottle the rusty cap squealing on its threads Popping upright the marine waved both hands and shouted
Of course it was water he really craved down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack Matsuo shook his head He had no water for an enemy And when this was gone he even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool
He capped the bottle and replaced it After all he had less reason to desire it than the marine
Before much longer the marine quieted down His head slumped The upper part of his packet had stained dark Marine There is nothing for you Matsuo said Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion besides the dishonor of it nothing for you
From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked with the village burning about him and shells exploding

Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows supporting his massive frame He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed
Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town boys He asked Seems to me I remember altering any law about that
He straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer Stay right here where you are kid he called I aim to have minors breathing down my neck when a-drinking
The stranger ignored him He stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver
Billy Tilghman said the stranger and come for Pat Conyers' body
And what makes you think going to get it pretty boy
Because asking Most of the time I get what I ask for
Blue Throat winked at his six cronies The kid has no manners boys Shall we teach him some His gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never left its holster Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin His head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling
Tilghman leapt on to him dragged him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against the bar A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting Tilghman flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun
The Colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing A third shot doused the light Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled You all right Billy
Yes George but I got poor old Pat's body yet And I aim to have it He fired again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor OK Tilghman quitting
And me said another Blue Throat henchman
Somebody brought a light Tilghman and his partner George Rust herded the men into a corner And now said Tilghman with deadly calm repeat what I said come for Pat Conyers' body
In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial Blue Throat nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the survivors of the fight
That critter will be back tomorrow predicted George Rust and bring fifty of his kind back with him Blue Throat stand for this shoot up the town
The prediction was correct The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie when shots were heard in the distance
Amen said the Reverend Doran grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle Blue Throat who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it
He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire
The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store halfway down the street Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived He sized up the situation and shook his head
If Blue Throat has his way keep us all cooped up in here for days he said only one thing to move him fast and we have it right here in this very store
He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite drop these into Blue Throat's lap he announced and like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window
He slipped outside hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways Blue Throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back Here he be seen by Blue Throat and his gang All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through
Billy Tilghman did just that Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts
To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet
Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West Uncle Billy Tilghman stands out head and shoulders He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book He saw the most action beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him
For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West
The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung
Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century
He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's Led by Bill Doolin these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks making liberal use of their guns Bill Doolin's ambition it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him
Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their houses Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers named Ed Dunn who lived at Rock Fort
On a bitterly cold day in January 1895 accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney which was belching out thick smoke
The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door Wait here Neal said Tilghman If I come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse
Leaving his rifle in the wagon Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher Ed Dunn
Hello Ed said Tilghman The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but move
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain
And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on Billy Tilghman The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide
Thinking fast Tilghman never hesitated for one instant He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang every man a killer
Cold day said Tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives seem to locate landmarks in this snow
The rancher was trembling He look Tilghman in the face Follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely Jed's homestead is on the south bank
Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body One false move on his part and he would be a dead man
Well he announced Guess be going now Ed and thanks for the warmup He strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive
But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly
Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown say or do anything he said softly Just get out of here without it looking as though in a hurry That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang
Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then
stay right here commanded Bill Doolin covering Red with his rifle Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back let him go
But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell Oklahoma where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets
Wiley Lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver

For several months now Jack Carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a Woman This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she radiated warmth a sweet warmth she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately When she would do these things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach Then he would run to the toilet behind the house Sometimes he did this three or four times a day for this Woman was almost always with him He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him But they never said anything so he figured it was all right
And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure He could not keep his eyes off her when at school when he went home at night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do When he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh
Miss Langford her first name was Evelyn was an attractive girl Tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her too it may have been there for a good while since she was twenty now but if it had been it had been smothered until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like Jack She would look at Jack with that hidden something in her eyes and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick
School began in August the hottest part of the year and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another The first two or three days they went home early
All that is except Jack He hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order Once this was on the third day of school she kneeled down to pick up some books where dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although probably she even see him He jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school
He look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath then he slowed to a walk The vision became even stronger now get her yet he muttered to himself got to get her That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the Woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire
He ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily
the matter honey She said with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child you hungry
No not hungry he said pushing back the bacon and eggs Outside it was already hot at 7:30 A.M. and it was getting hot in the kitchen He felt a little sick at his stomach
Are you sick
No he said be all right I guess this hot weather
you play hard today then And if you get sick ask the teacher to let you come home early Daddy left the car for me and going to town this afternoon
OK. I play hard he promised
Just then Charles Lever yelled Hey Jack from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door yelling Good-bye Mom over his shoulder
say boy Charles said grinning showing his huge yellow teeth Charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him
You know what I done last night Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school
Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were Charles' only apparent interest But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention so he usually invited them as he did now No What
I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry
A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind His heart beat faster Hell you say He said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles you do it
Hell I jist got on top of
No I mean you get her to do it
Hell I jist ask her
Jist like that
Hell yes been hangin' around me a lot here lately and I figgered I might as try it Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it
I never heard that
all over Branchville If get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself
I might try it one of these days Jack said wonderingly thinking of Miss Langford
When they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse Miss Langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without socks was out there with them trying to get them inside
Time for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand go inside
Oh come on Miss Langford play with us just onct one of the little girls begged smiling wistfully
No not now said the teacher Maybe at dinner time Come inside now
The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did
At noontime remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys except Charles went off out the road to play ball Why you playin' ball He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse Miss Langford come out and play with us like you promised several of the little girls called
druther stay here and watch the girls Charles grinned Maybe some of 'em will fall down and see up their dress
Maybe Jack said idly watching for Miss Langford
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse When she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down yelling Goody goody
play with 'em Jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants
O.K. Charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join the girls
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls Jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again Jack ran over offered her his hand and said Gosh sorry Miss Langford I mean to pull so hard
all right she said tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes It was my fault With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other When her hand touched his fire went through Jack and he felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go
Thank you she said dusting herself off
Will you play with us again Miss Langford One of the little girls said
No more today Maybe some other day
Oh shucks the girl said I believe play any more neither
Me neither others said and soon the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups and alone
Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun past Robert Allen's three-room tarpapered house toward the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes
When he came back to the schoolhouse his mind was made up He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class That should do it he thought because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school
The only drawback now to the plan decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack But got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly All right if you do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out Miss Langford said firmly not smiling You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems
And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home He scarcely saw them His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child How will I do it

On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman Lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family
The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured Look at your watch Col. Garvier It is almost time for and calinda to begin
Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name
Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy
The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds The dance was of Haitian origin
The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows He was possessive in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners He proudly wore the blue livery of her house for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie wife of the prominent surgeon Dr. Louis Lalaurie who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society She was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell she also was a sadist a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil
Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders The slender handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John
Shy actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields in carriages and in boathouses
This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection
What is your name boy Come a bit closer I bite you know
He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her Then he smiled shyly My name is Dandy Brandon missy I belong to Master Alexander Prieur
She said with intense feeling Come near let me feel your arms You look quite strong and healthy to me Dandy
Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage Lifting her skirts she climbed in never relinquishing her grip on his arm The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor
Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees Satisfied at last and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called to her liveried driver This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows
Aristide I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase $600 in gold in this chamois sack If the old fool argues about the price tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings Besides he owns 300 slaves One less matter to him
Aristide Devol the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat His bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner
Another youth Madame The coachman said softly This one is a tender chicken oui Such delicate beauty such fine flesh It will rip and shred easily for Madame
Be quiet Devol You are forgetting your place
The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon cowering in the back seat of the carriage to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street
Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion Dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head Dr. Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses He was about 50 years old
Another young man my dear Really you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning with displeasure
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster
Dandy is to be our house guest Louis I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation
Quite so my dear His room will be ready shortly
The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave Had Dandy been older or wiser instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume Besides her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth Also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony
So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home Airless and dingy though it was the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John
He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie after closing the door showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber
It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street he was carried out in a coroner's basket
Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited
A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the forthcoming races the latest fashions from Paris and Louisiana politics
Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase
It was Dandy Brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him The lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition
Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted Evil woman You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home
These were the last words he ever uttered Convulsively he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore
Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead The ball broke up in confusion Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures Delphine stood like stone her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse
But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story
I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy I brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night How he returned in such a ghastly condition or why I say Dr. Lalaurie and I even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs
She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion That poor boy He must have fallen in with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die Such a pitiful end
Though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder and even a jury feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady Moreover runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives
So the verdict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and the elite of the city accepting Delphine's testimony welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold Once again life went its serene way soirees fox hunts balls and dinners
The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital Then on July 2 there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip
Mrs. Victor Dominique socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight The manservant Devol and his mistress Delphine Lalaurie were pursuing a young girl an octoroon of cameo-like beauty across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion The girl was not more than 16 She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back
The bleeding girl was tiring fast the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street
The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice Help me somebody They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw

Bastards he would say all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff and the first chair clobbered me Since then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent and even indecent group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper
There nothin' faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you go someplace Feathertop would say The accommodations may not be the poshest but man There nobody askin' for your ticket stub neither
He had been conning the freights for a long long time now Ever since the hooch and the trouble with the Quartet and Midge and the child Ever since all that It had been a very long time that had no form and no end
He was as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own riding the dark train out Out and out and never to return again Till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped That was the day it ended
The freight car was cold early in the morning
He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina
He held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly
The train slowed at a road crossing and the big door slid open at first gratingly caught by grains of corn then with a clash into its slot
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor She pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and Feathertop's music pfffted away Now that is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner
A little thing but the right twist for the action that counted Hot that was the word hot Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings with the sun shining down over them A poet yet His thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however
Zingggg-O
Then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting
He was less to see but Feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight
Curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummer's blocky hands and a body that said well maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes but then finished
We made it Cappy the chick said
Yeah seems so it the boy laughed hugging her close
Ah-ah Feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants None of that We run a respectable house here
They whirled and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall He was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes He held the black plastic kazoo lightly
Come sit said Feathertop motioning them toward him That crap is softer over here
The girl smiled and started forward The boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm
Now stay with me Kitty he snapped irritably I vowed to take care of you and what do We know this guy
Oooo square bit Feathertop screwed his face up This guy was strictly from Outsville But nowhere
What is with this vow jazz Feathertop inquired lounging against the freight's vibrating wall
We we eloped Cappy said His head came up and he said it defiantly
Well congratulations Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand These two were going to be easy pickins They have much dough but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much And besides the chick had a little something the others have That was be fun collecting
But not just yet Feathertop was a connoisseur He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it Come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings just a poor ex-jazz man name of uh Boyd Smith He grinned at them wolfishly
That your name Mister the boy accused
And you know right Feathertop aimed a finger at him
Oh come on Cappy the girl chided okay a nice guy She started to move toward the hay bags dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her
Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle He cleared his throat it had been a long hot while since seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance
He had it all doped of course Slug the kid grab his dough at least enough to get to Philadelphia and then have a rockin' ball with the doll Hmm diddle
you come from Mr. uh Mr. Smith Kitty inquired politely
Where from He mused Out I been riding train for a ways now
They lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself
After a while Kitty murmured something to Cappy and he held her close answering just have to wait till we pull into Philly honey
the matter she go the bathroom Ernie found it immensely funny
The boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked
No Certainly not I mean no that what I said She snapped at him I only said I was hungry We had anything to eat all day
Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with leather handles ya say so fellow travelers Why we got dinner right here buddy help me set up the kitchen and have food in a minute or two
Cappy looked wary but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it He put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot
A charcoal pit man he said indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier Fan it he told Cappy handing him a sheet of newspaper
Yeah but we eat Charcoal
Fella Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man you try my ever-lovin' patience He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners
Hot dogs man Not the greatest but they stick to your belly insides
He ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil Almost immediately they began to sizzle He looked up and grinned
A Kroger's self-serve he explained I self-served
When they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette Nice kid Ernie thought too bad
How come riding the rods kids like you Ernie asked
Cappy looked down at his wide hands and did not reply But surprisingly Kitty's face came up and she said My father He want us to get married So we ran away
Why he want you to get hitched
This time even she did not answer She looked down at her hands too After a few seconds she said Dad like Cappy It was my fault
Cappy's head came around sharply Your fault hell It was all my fault If been careful it never he stopped abruptly
Ernie's eyebrows went up the matter
The girl still did not raise her eyes but she added simply pregnant
Cappy raged at himself Oh he was stupid her old man You never heard nothin' like it go have an abortion and go away to a convent and this and that like he was nuts or somethin'
Ernie nodded This was a slightly different matter He remembered Midge and the child But that had been a time before all this a time he think about A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out But these kids like him
Oh crap He thought Pull out of it old son These are just another couple of characters to roll What they got you get Now forget all this other
drink Ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket
Yeah Now that you offer The answer came from the open door of the boxcar From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade
Ernie stared at the man He was big Real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like a grizzly Road gang Ernie thought
You give me a drink fella The big man asked again taking a step into the boxcar
Ernie hesitated a moment This character could break him in half Sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder The man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring He took the bottle with undue belligerence and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely
He threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously He belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door
Well now he said and reached into his pocket I know I was have company in this car
going to Philadelphia Kitty said pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more
No I think so said the big man and it was the final clincher for Ernie He had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it
Maybe you and me will girlie but these two goin' nowhere
He advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car Ernie was screaming inside himself No damn you you take my meal ticket away from me
The newcomer stalked toward them and Kitty shied back her hand to her mouth Her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied by the rattling of the freight and then Cappy came off the floor his legs driving him hard The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs
The kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back The fist went down into the pile of flesh and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go Aaawww
Then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade
He held the knife aloft an instant an instant enough to press the stud The blade came out with a snick He fisted the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat
Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked Help him Help him Do something
