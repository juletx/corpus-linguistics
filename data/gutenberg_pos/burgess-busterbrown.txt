BUSTER/N BEAR/N GOES/N FISHING/V
Buster/R Bear/R yawned/V as/P he/Q lay/V on/P his/Q comfortable/G bed/N of/P leaves/N and/C watched/V the/D first/G early/G morning/N sunbeams/N creeping/V through/P the/D Green/R Forest/R to/P chase/V out/O the/D Black/R Shadows/R ./O
Once/A more/A he/Q yawned/V ,/O and/C slowly/A got/V to/P his/Q feet/N and/C shook/V himself/Q ./O
Then/A he/Q walked/V over/P to/P a/D big/G pine-tree/N ,/O stood/V up/O on/P his/Q hind/N legs/N ,/O reached/V as/A high/G up/P on/P the/D trunk/N of/P the/D tree/N as/P he/Q could/O ,/O and/C scratched/V the/D bark/N with/P his/Q great/G claws/N ./O
After/P that/P he/Q yawned/V until/P it/Q seemed/V as/P if/P his/Q jaws/N would/O crack/V ,/O and/C then/A sat/V down/A to/P think/V what/Q he/Q wanted/V for/P breakfast/N ./O
While/P he/Q sat/V there/A ,/O trying/V to/P make/V up/O his/Q mind/N what/Q would/O taste/V best/A ,/O he/Q was/V listening/V to/P the/D sounds/N that/P told/V of/P the/D waking/G of/P all/D the/D little/G people/N who/Q live/V in/P the/D Green/R Forest/R ./O
He/Q heard/V Sammy/R Jay/R way/N off/P in/P the/D distance/N screaming/V ,/O ``/O Thief/N !/O

and/C grinned/V ./O
``/O I/Q wonder/V ,/O ''/O thought/V Buster/R ,/O ``/O if/P some/D one/N has/V stolen/V Sammy/R 's/O breakfast/N ,/O or/C if/P he/Q has/V stolen/V the/D breakfast/N of/P some/D one/O else/A ./O
Probably/A he/Q is/V the/D thief/N himself/Q ./O ''/O
He/Q heard/V Chatterer/R the/D Red/R Squirrel/R scolding/N as/A fast/A as/P he/Q could/O make/V his/Q tongue/N go/V and/C working/V himself/Q into/P a/D terrible/G rage/N ./O
``/O Must/O be/V that/P Chatterer/R got/V out/P of/P bed/N the/D wrong/G way/N this/D morning/N ,/O ''/O thought/V he/Q ./O
He/Q heard/V Blacky/R the/D Crow/R cawing/N at/P the/D top/N of/P his/Q lungs/N ,/O and/C he/Q knew/V by/P the/D sound/N that/P Blacky/R was/V getting/V into/P mischief/N of/P some/D kind/N ./O
He/Q heard/V the/D sweet/G voices/N of/P happy/G little/G singers/N ,/O and/C they/Q were/V good/G to/P hear/V ./O
But/C most/A of/P all/D he/Q listened/V to/P a/D merry/N ,/O low/G ,/O silvery/G laugh/N that/O never/A stopped/V but/C went/V on/P and/C on/P ,/O until/P he/Q just/A felt/V as/P if/P he/Q must/O laugh/V too/A ./O
It/Q was/V the/D voice/N of/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R ./O
And/C as/P Buster/R listened/V it/Q suddenly/A came/V to/P him/Q just/A what/Q he/Q wanted/V for/P breakfast/N ./O
''I'/G m/N going/V fishing/N ,/O ''/O said/V he/Q in/P his/Q deep/G grumbly-rumbly/G voice/N to/P no/D one/N in/P particular/G ./O
``/O Yes/O ,/O Sir/R ,/O I'/G m/N going/V fishing/N ./O

He/Q shuffled/V along/A over/P to/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R ,/O and/C straight/A to/P a/D little/G pool/N of/P which/O he/Q knew/V ,/O and/C as/P he/Q drew/V near/P he/Q took/V the/D greatest/G care/N not/A to/P make/V the/D teeniest/G ,/O weeniest/D bit/N of/P noise/N ./O
Now/A it/Q just/A happened/V that/P early/A as/P he/Q was/V ,/O some/D one/O was/V before/P Buster/R Bear/R ./O
When/O he/Q came/V in/P sight/N of/P the/D little/G pool/N ,/O who/Q should/O he/Q see/V but/C another/D fisherman/N there/A ,/O who/Q had/V already/A caught/V a/D fine/G fat/G trout/N ./O

He/Q was/V just/A climbing/V up/P the/D bank/N with/P the/D fat/G trout/N in/P his/Q mouth/N ./O
Buster/R Bear/R 's/O own/G mouth/N watered/V as/P he/Q saw/V it/Q ./O
Little/G Joe/R sat/V down/A on/P the/D bank/N and/C prepared/V to/P enjoy/V his/Q breakfast/N ./O
He/Q had/V n't/A seen/V Buster/R Bear/R ,/O and/C he/Q did/V n't/A know/V that/P he/Q or/C any/D one/O else/A was/V anywhere/A near/A ./O
Buster/R Bear/R tiptoed/V up/O very/A softly/A until/P he/Q was/V right/A behind/P Little/R Joe/R Otter/R ./O
``/O Woof/R ,/O woof/N !/O ''/O

Little/G Joe/R Otter/R gave/V a/D frightened/G squeal/N and/C without/P even/A turning/V to/P see/V who/Q was/V speaking/V dropped/V his/Q fish/N and/C dived/V headfirst/A into/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R ./O
Buster/R Bear/R sprang/V forward/A and/C with/P one/O of/P his/Q big/G paws/N caught/V the/D fat/G trout/N just/A as/P it/Q was/V slipping/V back/A into/P the/D water/N ./O
``/O Here/A 's/V your/Q trout/N ,/O Mr./R Otter/R ,/O ''/O said/V he/Q ,/O as/P Little/R Joe/R put/V his/Q head/N out/P of/P water/N to/P see/V who/Q had/V frightened/V him/Q so./D ``/O Come/V and/C get/V it/Q ./O ''/O

The/D fact/N is/V ,/O he/Q was/V afraid/G to/P ./O

``/O It/Q 's/V too/A bad/G to/P waste/V such/G a/D fine/G fish/N ,/O ''/O said/V Buster/R thoughtfully/A ./O

II/R LITTLE/R JOE/R OTTER/R GETS/R EVEN/R WITH/R BUSTER/R BEAR/R Little/R Joe/R Otter/R was/V in/P a/D terrible/G rage/N ./O
It/Q was/V a/D bad/G beginning/N for/P a/D beautiful/G day/N and/C Little/G Joe/R knew/V it/Q ./O
But/C who/Q would/O n't/A be/V in/P a/D rage/N if/P his/Q breakfast/N was/V taken/V from/P him/Q just/A as/P he/Q was/V about/P to/P eat/V it/Q ?/O
Anyway/A ,/O that/D is/V what/Q Little/R Joe/R told/V Billy/R Mink/R ./O
Perhaps/A he/Q did/V n't/A tell/V it/Q quite/A exactly/A as/P it/Q was/V ,/O but/C you/Q know/V he/Q was/V very/A badly/A frightened/V at/P the/D time/N ./O
``/O I/Q was/V sitting/V on/P the/D bank/N of/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R beside/P one/O of/P the/D little/G pools/N ,/O ''/O he/Q told/V Billy/R Mink/R ,/O ``/O and/C was/V just/A going/V to/P eat/V a/D fat/G trout/N I/Q had/V caught/V ,/O when/O who/Q should/O come/V along/O but/C that/P great/G big/G bully/N ,/O Buster/R Bear/R ./O
He/Q took/V that/D fat/G trout/N away/A from/P me/Q and/C ate/V it/Q just/A as/P if/P it/Q belonged/V to/P him/Q !/O
I/Q hate/V him/Q !/O

Of/P course/N that/D was/V n't/A nice/G talk/N and/C anything/N but/C a/D nice/G spirit/N ,/O but/C Little/R Joe/R Otter/R 's/O temper/N is/V sometimes/A pretty/A short/G ,/O especially/A when/O he/Q is/V hungry/G ,/O and/C this/D time/N he/Q had/V had/V no/D breakfast/N ,/O you/Q know/V ./O
Buster/R Bear/R had/V n't/A actually/A taken/V the/D fish/N away/A from/P Little/G Joe/R ./O
But/C looking/V at/P the/D matter/N as/P Little/R Joe/R did/V ,/O it/Q amounted/V to/P the/D same/G thing/N ./O
You/Q see/V ,/O Buster/R knew/V perfectly/A well/A when/O he/Q invited/V Little/R Joe/R to/P come/V back/A and/C get/V it/Q that/P Little/R Joe/R would/O n't/A dare/V do/V anything/N of/P the/D kind/N ./O
``/O Where/O is/V he/Q now/A ?/O ''/O
asked/V Billy/R Mink/R ./O
``/O He/Q 's/V somewhere/A up/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R ./O
I/Q wish/V he/Q 'd/O fall/V in/P and/C get/V drowned/G !/O ''/O
snapped/V Little/R Joe/R ./O
Billy/R Mink/R just/A had/V to/P laugh/N ./O
The/D idea/N of/P great/G big/G Buster/R Bear/R getting/V drowned/V in/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R was/V too/A funny/G ./O
There/O was/V n't/A water/N enough/G in/P it/Q anywhere/A except/P down/A in/P the/D Smiling/V Pool/R ,/O and/C that/D was/V on/P the/D Green/R Meadows/R ,/O where/O Buster/R had/V never/A been/V known/V to/P go/V ./O
``/O Let/V 's/O go/V see/V what/Q he/Q is/V doing/V ,/O ''/O said/V Billy/R Mink/R ./O
At/P first/G Little/G Joe/R did/V n't/A want/V to/P ,/O but/C at/P last/G his/Q curiosity/N got/V the/D better/G of/P his/Q fear/N ,/O and/C he/Q agreed/V ./O
So/P the/D two/O little/G brown-coated/G scamps/N turned/V down/O the/D Laughing/N Brook/R ,/O taking/V the/D greatest/G care/N to/P keep/V out/P of/P sight/N themselves/Q ./O
They/Q had/V gone/V only/A a/D little/G way/N when/O Billy/R Mink/R whispered/V :/O ``/O Sh-h/G !/O
There/O he/Q is/V ./O ''/O
Sure/G enough/A ,/O there/O was/V Buster/R Bear/R sitting/V close/G beside/P a/D little/G pool/N and/C looking/V into/P it/Q very/A intently/A ./O
``/O What/Q 's/V he/Q doing/V ?/O ''/O
asked/V Little/R Joe/R Otter/R ,/O as/P Buster/R Bear/R sat/V for/P the/D longest/G time/N without/P moving/V ./O
Just/A then/A one/O of/P Buster/R 's/O big/G paws/N went/V into/P the/D water/N as/P quick/G as/P a/D flash/N and/C scooped/V out/O a/D trout/N that/O had/V ventured/V too/A near/A ./O
``/O He/Q 's/V fishing/N !/O ''/O
exclaimed/V Billy/R Mink/R ./O
And/C that/D is/V just/A what/Q Buster/R Bear/R was/V doing/V ,/O and/C it/Q was/V very/A plain/G to/P see/V that/P he/Q was/V having/V great/G fun/N ./O
When/O he/Q had/V eaten/V the/D trout/N he/Q had/V caught/V ,/O he/Q moved/V along/A to/P the/D next/G little/G pool/N ./O
``/O They/Q are/V _/V our/Q _/G fish/N !/O ''/O

``/O I/Q do/V n't/A see/V how/O we/Q are/V going/V to/P stop/V him/Q ,/O ''/O said/V Billy/R Mink/R ./O

cried/V Little/R Joe/R ,/O into/P whose/Q head/V an/D idea/N had/V just/A popped/V ./O
''I'/G m/N going/V to/P drive/V all/D the/D fish/N out/P of/P the/D little/G pools/N and/C muddy/G the/D water/N all/D up/A ./O

Just/A you/Q watch/V me/Q get/V even/A with/P Buster/R Bear/R ./O ''/O
Little/G Joe/R slipped/V swiftly/A into/P the/D water/N and/C swam/V straight/A to/P the/D little/G pool/N that/P Buster/R Bear/R would/O try/V next/G ./O
He/Q frightened/V the/D fish/N so/A that/P they/Q fled/V in/P every/D direction/N ./O
Then/A he/Q stirred/V up/O the/D mud/N until/P the/D water/N was/V so/A dirty/G that/P Buster/R could/O n't/A have/V seen/V a/D fish/A right/G under/P his/Q nose/N ./O
He/Q did/V the/D same/G thing/N in/P the/D next/G pool/N and/C the/D next/G ./O
Buster/R Bear/R 's/O fishing/N was/V spoiled/V for/P that/D day/N ./O
III/R BUSTER/R BEAR/R IS/V GREATLY/G PUZZLED/V Buster/R Bear/R had/V n't/A enjoyed/V himself/Q so/A much/A since/P he/Q came/V to/P the/D Green/R Forest/R to/P live/V ./O
His/Q fun/N began/V when/O he/Q surprised/V Little/R Joe/R Otter/R on/P the/D bank/N of/P a/D little/G pool/N in/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R and/C Little/R Joe/R was/V so/A frightened/G that/P he/Q dropped/V a/D fat/G trout/N he/Q had/V just/A caught/V ./O
It/Q had/V seemed/V like/P a/D great/G joke/N to/P Buster/R Bear/R ,/O and/C he/Q had/V chuckled/V over/P it/Q all/D the/D time/N he/Q was/V eating/V the/D fat/G trout/N ./O
When/O he/Q had/V finished/V it/Q ,/O he/Q started/V on/P to/P do/V some/D fishing/N himself/Q ./O
Presently/A he/Q came/V to/P another/D little/G pool/N ./O
He/Q stole/V up/O to/P it/Q very/A ,/O very/A softly/A ,/O so/A as/P not/A to/P frighten/V the/D fish/N ./O
Then/A he/Q sat/V down/A close/A to/P the/D edge/N of/P it/Q and/C did/V n't/A move/V ./O
Buster/R learned/V a/D long/G time/N ago/P that/P a/D fisherman/N must/O be/V patient/G unless/P ,/O like/P Little/R Joe/R Otter/R ,/O he/Q is/V just/A as/A much/G at/P home/N in/P the/D water/N as/P the/D fish/N themselves/Q ,/O and/C can/O swim/V fast/A enough/A to/P catch/V them/Q by/P chasing/V them/Q ./O
So/P he/Q did/V n't/A move/V so/A much/A as/P an/D eye/N lash/N ./O
He/Q was/V so/A still/A that/P he/Q looked/V almost/A like/P the/D stump/N of/P an/D old/G tree/N ./O
Perhaps/A that/D is/V what/Q the/D fish/N thought/V he/Q was/V ,/O for/P pretty/A soon/A ,/O two/O or/C three/O swam/V right/A in/P close/A to/P where/O he/Q was/V sitting/V ./O
Now/A Buster/R Bear/R may/O be/V big/G and/C clumsy/G looking/V ,/O but/C there/O is/V n't/A anything/N that/O can/O move/V much/A quicker/G than/P one/O of/P those/D big/G paws/N of/P his/Q when/O he/Q wants/V it/Q to/P ./O
One/O of/P them/Q moved/V now/A ,/O and/C quicker/G than/P a/D wink/N had/V scooped/V one/O of/P those/D foolish/G fish/N out/P on/P to/P the/D bank/N ./O
Buster/R 's/O little/G eyes/N twinkled/G ,/O and/C he/Q smacked/V his/Q lips/N as/P he/Q moved/V on/P to/P the/D next/G little/G pool/N ,/O for/P he/Q knew/V that/P it/Q was/V of/P no/D use/N to/P stay/V longer/A at/P the/D first/G one/O ./O
The/D fish/N were/V so/A frightened/G that/P they/Q would/O n't/A come/V back/A for/P a/D long/G ,/O long/G time/N ./O
At/P the/D next/G little/G pool/V the/D same/G thing/N happened/V ./O
By/P this/D time/N Buster/R Bear/R was/V in/P fine/G spirits/N ./O
It/Q was/V fun/N to/P catch/V the/D fish/N ,/O and/C it/Q was/V still/A more/G fun/N to/P eat/V them/Q ./O
What/Q finer/N breakfast/N could/O any/A one/O have/V than/P fresh-caught/G trout/N ?/O
No/D wonder/N he/Q felt/V good/G !/O
But/C it/Q takes/V more/G than/P three/O trout/N to/P fill/V Buster/R Bear/R 's/O stomach/N ,/O so/P he/Q kept/V on/P to/P the/D next/G little/G pool/N ./O
But/C this/D little/G pool/N ,/O instead/A of/P being/V beautiful/G and/C clear/G so/A that/P Buster/N could/O see/V right/G to/P the/D bottom/N of/P it/Q and/C so/A tell/V if/P there/O were/V any/D fish/N there/A ,/O was/V so/A muddy/G that/P he/Q could/O n't/A see/V into/P it/Q at/P all/D ./O
It/Q looked/V as/P if/P some/D one/N had/V just/A stirred/V up/O all/D the/D mud/N at/P the/D bottom/N ./O
``/O Huh/O !/O ''/O
said/V Buster/R Bear/R ./O
``/O It/Q 's/V of/P no/D use/N to/P try/V to/P fish/A here/A ./O

Then/A he/Q went/V on/P to/P another/D ,/O and/C this/D was/V no/D better/G ./O
Buster/R sat/V down/A and/C scratched/V his/Q head/N ./O
It/Q was/V puzzling/G ./O
Yes/O ,/O Sir/R ,/O it/Q was/V puzzling/G ./O
He/Q looked/V this/D way/N and/C he/Q looked/V that/P way/N suspiciously/A ,/O but/C there/O was/V no/D one/N to/P be/V seen/V ./O
Everything/N was/V still/A save/V for/P the/D laughter/N of/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R ./O

``/O It/Q 's/V very/A curious/G ,/O ''/O muttered/V Buster/R ,/O ``/O very/A curious/G indeed/A ./O

And/C then/A ,/O because/P Buster/R Bear/R always/A enjoys/V a/D good/G joke/N even/A when/O it/Q is/V on/P himself/Q ,/O he/Q laughed/V until/P he/Q had/V to/P hold/V his/Q sides/N ,/O which/O is/V a/D whole/G lot/N better/A than/P going/V off/O in/P a/D rage/N as/P Little/R Joe/R Otter/R had/V done/V ./O

VIII/R FARMER/R BROWN/R 'S/O BOY/R FEELS/R HIS/R HAIR/R RISE/R 'Twas/R just/A a/D sudden/G odd/G surprise/N Made/V Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N 's/O hair/N to/P rise/V ./O

There/O are/V just/A two/O things/N that/O make/V hair/N rise/N --/O anger/N and/C fear/N ./O

It/Q never/A had/V happened/V before/A ./O
You/Q see/V ,/O there/O is/V n't/A much/G of/P anything/N that/O Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N is/V really/A afraid/G of/P ./O
Perhaps/A he/Q would/O n't/A have/V been/V afraid/G this/D time/N if/P it/Q had/V n't/A been/V for/P the/D surprise/N of/P what/Q he/Q found/V ./O
You/Q see/V when/O he/Q had/V found/V the/D heads/N of/P those/D trout/N on/P the/D bank/N he/Q knew/V right/A away/A that/P some/D one/O else/A had/V been/V fishing/N ,/O and/C that/D was/V why/O he/Q could/O n't/A catch/V any/D ;/O but/C it/Q did/V n't/A seem/V possible/G that/P little/G Billy/R Mink/R could/O have/V eaten/V all/D those/D trout/N ,/O and/C Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N did/V n't/A once/A think/V of/P Little/R Joe/R Otter/R ,/O and/C so/A he/Q was/V very/A ,/O very/A much/A puzzled/V ./O
He/Q was/V turning/V it/Q all/D over/A in/P his/Q mind/N and/C studying/V what/Q it/Q could/O mean/V ,/O when/O he/Q came/V to/P a/D little/A muddy/G place/N on/P the/D bank/N of/P the/D Laughing/R Brook/R ,/O and/C there/O he/Q saw/V something/N that/O made/V his/Q eyes/N look/V as/A if/P they/Q would/O pop/V right/G out/P of/P his/Q head/N ,/O and/C it/Q was/V right/A then/A that/P he/Q felt/V his/Q hair/N rise/N ./O
Anyway/A ,/O that/D is/V what/Q he/Q said/V when/O he/Q told/V about/P it/Q afterward/A ./O
What/Q was/V it/Q he/Q saw/V ?/O
What/Q do/V you/Q think/V ?/O
Why/O ,/O it/Q was/V a/D footprint/N in/P the/D soft/G mud/N ./O

It/Q was/V the/D footprint/N of/P Buster/R Bear/R ./O
Now/A Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N did/V n't/A know/V that/D Buster/R Bear/R had/V come/V down/O to/P the/D Green/R Forest/R to/P live/V ./O
He/Q never/A had/V heard/V of/P a/D Bear/R being/V in/P the/D Green/R Forest/R ./O
And/C so/A he/Q was/V so/A surprised/G that/P he/Q had/V hard/A work/N to/P believe/V his/Q own/G eyes/N ,/O and/C he/Q had/V a/D queer/G feeling/N all/D over/P ,/O --/O a/D little/G chilly/G feeling/N ,/O although/P it/Q was/V a/D warm/G day/N ./O
Somehow/A ,/O he/Q did/V n't/A feel/V like/P meeting/V Buster/R Bear/R ./O
If/P he/Q had/V had/V his/Q terrible/G gun/N with/P him/Q ,/O it/Q might/O have/V been/V different/G ./O
But/C he/Q did/V n't/A ,/O and/C so/A he/Q suddenly/A made/V up/O his/Q mind/N that/P he/Q did/V n't/A want/V to/P fish/A any/D more/G that/P day/N ./O
He/Q had/V a/D funny/G feeling/N ,/O too/A ,/O that/P he/Q was/V being/V watched/V ,/O although/P he/Q could/O n't/A see/V any/D one/O ./O
He/Q _/A was/V _/A being/V watched/V ./O
Little/G Joe/R Otter/R and/C Buster/R Bear/R were/V watching/V him/Q and/C taking/V the/D greatest/G care/N to/P keep/V out/P of/P his/Q sight/N ./O
All/D the/D way/N home/N through/P the/D Green/R Forest/R ,/O Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N kept/V looking/V behind/P him/Q ,/O and/C he/Q did/V n't/A draw/V a/D long/G breath/N until/P he/Q reached/V the/D edge/N of/P the/D Green/R Forest/R ./O
He/Q had/V n't/A run/V ,/O but/C he/Q had/V wanted/V to/P ./O
``/O Huh/O !/O ''/O

You/Q see/V ,/O they/Q had/V all/D been/V afraid/G of/P Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N for/P so/A long/A that/P they/Q were/V tickled/V almost/A to/P pieces/N at/P the/D very/G thought/N of/P having/V some/D one/O in/P the/D Green/R Forest/R who/Q could/O make/V Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N feel/N fear/N as/P they/Q had/V felt/V it/Q ./O

You/Q see/V ,/O it/Q was/V the/D most/A exciting/G moment/N ever/A was/V in/P the/D Green/R Forest/R ./O
Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N had/V just/A stepped/V out/O from/P behind/P one/O side/N of/P a/D little/G hemlock-tree/N and/C Buster/R Bear/R had/V just/A stepped/V out/O from/P behind/P the/D opposite/G side/N of/P the/D little/G hemlock-tree/N and/C neither/D had/V known/V that/P the/D other/N was/V anywhere/A near/A ./O

Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N opened/V his/Q mouth/N and/C yelled/V !/O

XV/R BUSTER/R BEAR/N IS/V A/D FALLEN/R HERO/R A/R fallen/G hero/N is/V some/D one/O to/P whom/Q every/D one/O has/V looked/V up/O as/P very/A brave/G and/C then/A proves/V to/P be/V less/A brave/G than/P he/Q was/V supposed/V to/P be/V ./O
That/D was/V the/D way/N with/P Buster/R Bear/R ./O
When/O Little/R Joe/R Otter/R had/V told/V how/O Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N had/V been/V afraid/G at/P the/D mere/G sight/N of/P one/O of/P Buster/R Bear/R 's/O big/G footprints/N ,/O they/Q had/V at/P once/A made/V a/D hero/N of/P Buster/R ./O
At/P least/G some/D of/P them/Q had/V ./O
As/P this/D was/V the/D first/G time/N ,/O the/D very/A first/G time/N ,/O that/P they/Q had/V ever/A known/V any/D one/N who/Q lives/V in/P the/D Green/R Forest/R to/P make/V Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N run/V away/A ,/O they/Q looked/V on/P Buster/R Bear/R with/P a/D great/G deal/N of/P respect/N and/C were/V very/A proud/G of/P him/Q ./O
But/C now/A they/Q had/V seen/V Buster/R Bear/R and/C Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N meet/V face/N to/P face/N ;/O and/C while/P it/Q was/V true/G that/P Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N had/V run/V away/A as/A fast/G as/P ever/A he/Q could/O ,/O it/Q was/V also/A true/G that/P Buster/R Bear/R had/V done/V the/D same/G thing/N ./O

It/Q was/V hard/G to/P believe/V ,/O but/C it/Q was/V true/G ./O
And/C right/A away/A everybody/N lost/V a/D great/G deal/N of/P the/D respect/N for/P Buster/N which/O they/Q had/V felt/V ./O
It/Q is/V always/A that/D way/N ./O
They/Q began/V to/P say/V unkind/G things/N about/P him/Q ./O
They/Q said/V them/Q among/P themselves/Q ,/O and/C some/D of/P them/Q even/A said/V them/Q to/P Buster/V when/O they/Q met/V him/Q ,/O or/C said/V them/Q so/A that/P he/Q would/O hear/V them/Q ./O
Of/P course/N Blacky/P the/D Crow/R and/C Sammy/R Jay/R ,/O who/Q ,/O because/P they/Q can/O fly/V ,/O have/V nothing/N to/P fear/V from/P Buster/R ,/O and/C who/Q always/A delight/N in/P making/V other/G people/N uncomfortable/G ,/O never/A let/V a/D chance/N go/V by/O to/P tell/V Buster/R and/C everybody/N else/A within/P hearing/V what/Q they/Q thought/V of/P him/Q ./O
They/Q delighted/V in/P flying/V about/P through/P the/D Green/R Forest/R until/P they/Q had/V found/V Buster/R Bear/R and/C then/A from/P the/D safety/N of/P the/D tree/N tops/N screaming/V at/P him/Q ./O

He/Q ran/V to/P the/D very/G top/N of/P the/D tree/N ,/O so/A frightened/V that/P his/Q teeth/N chattered/V ,/O and/C when/O he/Q looked/V down/A and/C saw/V Buster/R 's/O great/G mouth/N coming/V nearer/P and/C nearer/P ,/O he/Q nearly/A tumbled/V down/A with/P terror/N ./O
The/D worst/G of/P it/Q was/V there/A was/V n't/A another/D tree/N near/P enough/G for/P him/Q to/P jump/V to/P ./O

Chatterer/R was/V in/P the/D worst/G kind/N of/P trouble/N ,/O and/C there/O was/V no/D one/N to/P blame/V but/C himself/Q ./O

Down/R ,/O down/A ,/O down/P he/Q sailed/V and/C landed/V on/P his/Q feet/N ./O

XVII/R BUSTER/R BEAR/R GOES/R BERRYING/R Buster/R Bear/R is/V a/D great/G hand/N to/P talk/V to/P himself/Q when/O he/Q thinks/V no/D one/N is/V around/A to/P overhear/V ./O
It/Q 's/V a/D habit/N ./O
However/A ,/O it/Q is/V n't/A a/D bad/G habit/N unless/P it/Q is/V carried/V too/A far/A ./O
Any/D habit/N becomes/V bad/G ,/O if/P it/Q is/V carried/V too/A far/A ./O
Suppose/V you/Q had/V a/D secret/G ,/O a/D real/G secret/N ,/O something/N that/P nobody/N else/A knew/V and/C that/P you/Q did/V n't/A want/V anybody/N else/A to/P know/V ./O
And/C suppose/V you/Q had/V the/D habit/N of/P talking/V to/P yourself/Q ./O
You/Q might/O ,/O without/P thinking/N ,/O you/Q know/V ,/O tell/V that/P secret/N out/P loud/G to/P yourself/Q ,/O and/C some/D one/N might/O ,/O just/A might/O happen/V to/P overhear/V !/O
Then/A there/O would/O n't/A be/V any/D secret/N ./O
That/D is/V the/D way/N that/P a/D habit/N which/O is/V n't/A bad/G in/P itself/Q can/O become/V bad/G when/O it/Q is/V carried/V too/A far/A ./O
Now/A Buster/R Bear/R had/V lived/V by/P himself/Q in/P the/D Great/R Woods/R so/A long/A that/P this/D habit/N of/P talking/V to/P himself/Q had/V grown/V and/C grown/V ./O

XX/R BUSTER/R BEAR/N CARRIES/N OFF/P THE/D PAIL/N OF/P FARMER/R BROWN/R 'S/O BOY/G The/D question/N is/V ,/O did/V Buster/R Bear/R steal/V Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N 's/O pail/N ?/O

There/O is/V no/D doubt/N that/P he/Q stole/V the/D berries/N that/O were/V in/P the/D pail/N when/O he/Q found/V it/Q ,/O for/P he/Q deliberately/A ate/V them/Q ./O

Buster/R is/V so/A fond/G of/P berries/N that/O from/P the/D very/A second/G that/P his/Q greedy/G little/G eyes/N saw/V that/P pailful/G ,/O he/Q forgot/V everything/N but/C the/D feast/N that/O was/V waiting/V for/P him/Q right/A under/P his/Q very/A nose/N ./O

It/Q was/V a/D comical/G little/G whistle/N of/P chagrin/N as/P he/Q realized/V that/P he/Q had/V nothing/N in/P which/O to/P put/V more/G berries/N ,/O even/A if/P he/Q picked/V them/Q ./O
``/O It/Q 's/V worse/G than/P I/Q thought/V ,/O ''/O cried/V he/Q ./O
``/O That/D bear/N has/V cheated/V me/Q out/P of/P that/D berry/N pie/N my/Q mother/N promised/V me/Q ./O ''/O
Then/A he/Q began/V to/P laugh/N ,/O as/P he/Q thought/V of/P how/O funny/G Buster/R Bear/R had/V looked/V with/P the/D pail/N about/P his/Q neck/N ,/O and/C then/A because/P ,/O you/Q know/V he/Q is/V learning/V to/P be/V a/D philosopher/N ,/O he/Q once/A more/A repeated/V ,/O ``/O It/Q might/O have/V been/V worse/G ./O
Yes/R ,/O indeed/A ,/O it/Q might/O have/V been/V worse/G ./O

I/Q guess/V I'/G ll/N go/V eat/V that/P lunch/N I/Q left/V back/A by/P the/D spring/N ,/O and/C then/A I'/V ll/A go/V home/N ./O
I/Q can/O pick/V berries/N some/D other/G day/N ./O ''/O
Chuckling/V happily/A over/P Buster/R Bear/R 's/O great/G fright/N ,/O Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N tramped/V back/A to/P the/D spring/N where/O he/Q had/V left/V two/O thick/G sandwiches/N on/P a/D flat/G stone/N when/O he/Q started/V to/P save/V his/Q pail/N of/P berries/N ./O
``/O My/R ,/O but/C those/D sandwiches/N will/O taste/V good/G ,/O ''/O thought/V he/Q ./O
''I'/D m/N glad/G they/Q are/V big/G and/C thick/G ./O
I/Q never/A was/V hungrier/V in/P my/Q life/N ./O
Hello/O !/O ''/O
This/D he/Q exclaimed/V right/A out/P loud/G ,/O for/P he/Q had/V just/A come/V in/P sight/N of/P the/D flat/G stone/N where/O the/D sandwiches/N should/O have/V been/V ,/O and/C they/Q were/V not/A there/A ./O
No/D ,/O Sir/R ,/O there/O was/V n't/A so/A much/G as/P a/D crumb/G left/N of/P those/D two/O thick/G sandwiches/N ./O
You/Q see/V ,/O Old/R Man/R Coyote/R had/V found/V them/Q and/C gobbled/V them/Q up/O while/P Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N was/V away/A ./O
But/C Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N did/V n't/A know/V anything/N about/P Old/R Man/R Coyote/R ./O
He/Q rubbed/V his/Q eyes/N and/C stared/V everywhere/A ,/O even/A up/P in/P the/D trees/N ,/O as/P if/P he/Q thought/V those/D sandwiches/N might/O be/V hanging/V up/P there/O ./O
They/Q had/V disappeared/V as/P completely/A as/P if/P they/Q never/A had/V been/V ,/O and/C Old/R Man/R Coyote/R had/V taken/V care/N to/P leave/V no/D trace/N of/P his/Q visit/N ./O
Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N gaped/V foolishly/A this/D way/N and/C that/D way/N ./O
Then/A ,/O instead/A of/P growing/V angry/G ,/O a/D slow/G smile/N stole/V over/P his/Q freckled/G face/N ./O
``/O I/Q guess/V some/D one/O else/A was/V hungry/G too/A ,/O ''/O he/Q muttered/V ./O

So/P Farmer/R Brown/R 's/O boy/N made/V his/Q lunch/N on/P blueberries/N and/C then/A rather/A sheepishly/A he/Q started/V for/P home/N to/P tell/V of/P all/D the/D strange/G things/N that/O had/V happened/V to/P him/Q in/P the/D Old/R Pasture/R ./O
