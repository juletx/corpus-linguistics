THE/D COCK-A-DOO-DLE-DOO/R A/D very/A little/G boy/N made/V this/D story/N up/P ``/O out/P of/P his/Q head/N ,/O ''/O and/C told/V it/Q to/P his/Q papa/N ./O
I/Q think/V you/Q littlest/G ones/N will/O like/V it/Q ;/O I/Q do./V ./O
Once/A upon/P a/D time/N there/A was/V a/D little/G boy/N ,/O and/C he/Q wanted/V to/P be/V a/D cock-a-doo-dle-doo/N ./O

THE/D CLOUD/R One/O hot/G summer/N morning/N a/D little/G Cloud/N rose/V out/P of/P the/D sea/N and/C floated/V lightly/A and/C happily/A across/P the/D blue/G sky/N ./O
Far/A below/A lay/V the/D earth/N ,/O brown/N ,/O dry/G ,/O and/C desolate/G ,/O from/P drought/N ./O
The/D little/G Cloud/N could/O see/V the/D poor/G people/N of/P the/D earth/N working/V and/C suffering/V in/P the/D hot/G fields/N ,/O while/P she/Q herself/Q floated/V on/P the/D morning/N breeze/N ,/O hither/G and/C thither/G ,/O without/P a/D care/N ./O
``/O Oh/O ,/O if/P I/Q could/O only/A help/V the/D poor/G people/N down/P there/A !/O ''/O

``/O If/P I/Q could/O but/C make/V their/Q work/N easier/A ,/O or/C give/V the/D hungry/G ones/N food/N ,/O or/C the/D thirsty/N a/D drink/N !/O ''/O
And/C as/P the/D day/N passed/V ,/O and/C the/D Cloud/R became/V larger/G ,/O this/D wish/N to/P do/V something/N for/P the/D people/N of/P earth/N was/V ever/A greater/G in/P her/Q heart/N ./O
On/P earth/N it/Q grew/V hotter/N and/C hotter/N ;/O the/D sun/N burned/V down/A so/A fiercely/A that/P the/D people/N were/V fainting/V in/P its/Q rays/N ;/O it/Q seemed/V as/P if/P they/Q must/O die/V of/P heat/N ,/O and/C yet/A they/Q were/V obliged/V to/P go/V on/P with/P their/Q work/N ,/O for/P they/Q were/V very/A poor/G ./O
Sometimes/A they/Q stood/V and/C looked/V up/O at/P the/D Cloud/R ,/O as/P if/P they/Q were/V praying/V ,/O and/C saying/V ,/O ``/O Ah/O ,/O if/P you/Q could/O help/V us/Q !/O ''/O
``/O I/Q will/O help/V you/Q ;/O I/Q will/O !/O ''/O
said/V the/D Cloud/R ./O
And/C she/Q began/V to/P sink/V softly/A down/A toward/P the/D earth/N ./O
But/C suddenly/A ,/O as/P she/Q floated/V down/O ,/O she/Q remembered/V something/N which/O had/V been/V told/V her/Q when/O she/Q was/V a/D tiny/G Cloud-child/G ,/O in/P the/D lap/N of/P Mother/R Ocean/R :/O it/Q had/V been/V whispered/V that/P if/P the/D Clouds/N go/V too/A near/A the/D earth/N they/Q die/V ./O
When/O she/Q remembered/V this/D she/Q held/V herself/Q from/P sinking/V ,/O and/C swayed/V here/A and/C there/A on/P the/D breeze/N ,/O thinking/N ,/O --/O thinking/N ./O
But/C at/P last/G she/Q stood/V quite/A still/A ,/O and/C spoke/V boldly/A and/C proudly/A ./O
She/Q said/V ,/O ``/O Men/N of/P earth/N ,/O I/Q will/O help/V you/Q ,/O come/V what/Q may/O !/O ''/O
The/D thought/N made/V her/Q suddenly/A marvellously/A big/G and/C strong/G and/C powerful/G ./O
Never/A had/V she/Q dreamed/V that/P she/Q could/O be/V so/A big/G ./O
Like/P a/D mighty/G angel/N of/P blessing/N she/Q stood/V above/P the/D earth/N ,/O and/C lifted/V her/Q head/N and/C spread/V her/Q wings/N far/A over/P the/D fields/N and/C woods/N ./O
She/Q was/V so/A great/G ,/O so/P majestic/G ,/O that/P men/N and/C animals/N were/V awe-struck/G at/P the/D sight/N ;/O the/D trees/N and/C the/D grasses/N bowed/V before/P her/Q ;/O yet/A all/D the/D earth-creatures/N felt/V that/P she/Q meant/V them/Q well/A ./O
``/O Yes/O ,/O I/Q will/O help/V you/Q ,/O ''/O cried/V the/D Cloud/N once/A more/A ./O
``/O Take/V me/Q to/P yourselves/Q ;/O I/Q will/O give/V my/Q life/N for/P you/Q !/O ''/O
As/P she/Q said/V the/D words/N a/D wonderful/G light/N glowed/V from/P her/Q heart/N ,/O the/D sound/N of/P thunder/N rolled/V through/P the/D sky/N ,/O and/C a/D love/N greater/G than/P words/N can/O tell/V filled/V the/D Cloud/N ;/O down/A ,/O down/A ,/O close/A to/P the/D earth/N she/Q swept/V ,/O and/C gave/V up/O her/Q life/N in/P a/D blessed/V ,/O healing/V shower/N of/P rain/N ./O
That/D rain/N was/V the/D Cloud/R 's/O great/G deed/N ;/O it/Q was/V her/Q death/N ,/O too/A ;/O but/C it/Q was/V also/A her/Q glory/N ./O
Over/P the/D whole/G country-side/N ,/O as/A far/A as/P the/D rain/N fell/V ,/O a/D lovely/G rainbow/N sprang/V its/Q arch/N ,/O and/C all/D the/D brightest/G rays/N of/P heaven/N made/V its/Q colours/N ;/O it/Q was/V the/D last/G greeting/N of/P a/D love/N so/A great/G that/P it/Q sacrificed/V itself/Q ./O
Soon/A that/P ,/O too/A ,/O was/V gone/V ,/O but/C long/A ,/O long/A afterward/A the/D men/N and/C animals/N who/Q were/V saved/V by/P the/D Cloud/R kept/V her/Q blessing/N in/P their/Q hearts/N ./O

THE/D LARKS/R IN/P THE/D CORNFIELD/N There/A was/V once/A a/D family/N of/P little/G Larks/N who/Q lived/V with/P their/Q mother/N in/P a/D nest/N in/P a/D cornfield/N ./O

A/D TRUE/G STORY/N ABOUT/R A/R GIRL/R Once/A there/O were/V four/O little/G girls/N who/Q lived/V in/P a/D big/G ,/O bare/G house/N ,/O in/P the/D country/N ./O
They/Q were/V very/A poor/G ,/O but/C they/Q had/V the/D happiest/G times/N you/Q ever/A heard/V of/P ,/O because/P they/Q were/V very/A rich/G in/P everything/N except/P money/N ./O
They/Q had/V a/D wonderful/G ,/O wise/G father/N ,/O who/Q knew/V stories/N to/P tell/V ,/O and/C who/Q taught/V them/Q their/Q lessons/N in/P such/G a/D beautiful/G way/N that/P it/Q was/V better/A than/P play/N ;/O they/Q had/V a/D lovely/G ,/O merry/N ,/O kind/N mother/N ,/O who/Q was/V never/A too/A tired/G to/P help/V them/Q work/V or/C watch/V them/Q play/V ;/O and/C they/Q had/V all/D the/D great/G green/G country/N to/P play/V in/P ./O
There/O were/V dark/G ,/O shadowy/G woods/N ,/O and/C fields/N of/P flowers/N ,/O and/C a/D river/N ./O
And/C there/O was/V a/D big/G barn/N ./O
One/O of/P the/D little/G girls/N was/V named/V Louisa/R ./O
She/Q was/V very/A pretty/A ,/O and/C ever/A so/A strong/G ;/O she/Q could/O run/V for/P miles/N through/P the/D woods/N and/C not/A get/V tired/V ./O
She/Q had/V a/D splendid/G brain/N in/P her/Q little/G head/N ;/O it/Q liked/V study/N ,/O and/C it/Q thought/V interesting/G thoughts/N all/D day/N long/A ./O
Louisa/R liked/V to/P sit/V in/P a/D corner/N by/P herself/Q ,/O sometimes/A ,/O and/C write/V thoughts/N in/P her/Q diary/N ;/O all/D the/D little/G girls/N kept/V diaries/N ./O
She/Q liked/V to/P make/V up/O stories/N out/P of/P her/Q own/G head/N ,/O and/C sometimes/A she/Q made/V verses/N ./O
When/O the/D four/O little/G sisters/N had/V finished/V their/Q lessons/N ,/O and/C had/V helped/V their/Q mother/N wash/V up/A and/C sew/V ,/O they/Q used/V to/P go/V to/P the/D big/G barn/N to/P play/V ;/O and/C the/D best/G play/N of/P all/D was/V theatricals/N ./O
Louisa/R liked/V theatricals/P better/G than/P anything/N ./O
They/Q made/V the/D barn/N into/P a/D theatre/N ,/O and/C the/D grown-up/G people/N came/V to/P see/V the/D plays/N they/Q acted/V ./O
They/Q used/V to/P climb/V up/O on/P the/D hay-loft/G for/P a/D stage/N ,/O and/C the/D grown/G people/N sat/V in/P chairs/N on/P the/D floor/N ./O
It/Q was/V great/G fun/N ./O
One/O of/P the/D plays/N they/Q acted/V was/V _/G Jack/R and/C the/D Beanstalk/R _/N ./O
They/Q had/V a/D ladder/N from/P the/D floor/N to/P the/D loft/N ,/O and/C on/P the/D ladder/N they/Q tied/V a/D vine/N all/D the/D way/N up/P to/P the/D loft/N ,/O to/P look/V like/P the/D wonderful/G beanstalk/N ./O
One/O of/P the/D little/G girls/N was/V dressed/V up/O to/P look/V like/P Jack/R ,/O and/C she/Q acted/V that/P part/N ./O
When/O it/Q came/V to/P the/D place/N in/P the/D story/N where/O the/D giant/G tried/V to/P follow/V Jack/R ,/O the/D little/G girl/N cut/V down/O the/D beanstalk/N ,/O and/C down/A came/V the/D giant/N tumbling/V from/P the/D loft/N ./O
The/D giant/N was/V made/V out/P of/P pillows/N ,/O with/P a/D great/G ,/O fierce/G head/N of/P paper/N ,/O and/C funny/G clothes/N ./O
Another/D story/N that/P they/Q acted/V was/V _/G Cinderella/R _/N ./O

One/O other/G beautiful/G story/N they/Q used/V to/P play/V ./O
It/Q was/V the/D story/N of/P _/R Pilgrim/R 's/O Progress/R _/N ;/O if/P you/Q have/V never/A heard/V it/Q ,/O you/Q must/O be/V sure/G to/P read/V it/Q as/A soon/A as/P you/Q can/O read/V well/A enough/G to/P understand/V the/D old-fashioned/G words/N ./O
The/D little/G girls/N used/V to/P put/V shells/N in/P their/Q hats/N for/P a/D sign/N they/Q were/V on/P a/D pilgrimage/N ,/O as/P the/D old/G pilgrims/N used/V to/P do/V ;/O then/A they/Q made/V journeys/N over/P the/D hill/N behind/P the/D house/N ,/O and/C through/P the/D woods/N ,/O and/C down/P the/D lanes/N ;/O and/C when/O the/D pilgrimage/N was/V over/P they/Q had/V apples/N and/C nuts/N to/P eat/V ,/O in/P the/D happy/G land/N of/P home/N ./O
Louisa/R loved/V all/D these/D plays/N ,/O and/C she/Q made/V some/D of/P her/Q own/G and/C wrote/V them/Q down/O so/A that/P the/D children/N could/O act/V them/Q ./O
But/C better/G than/P fun/N or/C writing/V Louisa/R loved/V her/Q mother/N ,/O and/C by/P and/C by/P ,/O as/P the/D little/G girl/N began/V to/P grow/V into/P a/D big/G girl/N ,/O she/Q felt/V very/A sad/G to/P see/V her/Q dear/N mother/N work/N so/A hard/A ./O

At/P last/G ,/O as/P Louisa/R thought/V about/P it/Q ,/O she/Q came/V to/P care/V more/A about/P helping/V her/Q mother/N and/C her/Q father/N and/C her/Q sisters/N than/P about/P anything/N else/A in/P all/D the/D world/N ./O

THE/D LITTLE/R FIR/O TREE/N When/O I/Q was/V a/D very/A little/G girl/N some/D one/O ,/O probably/A my/Q mother/N ,/O read/V to/P me/Q Hans/R Christian/R Andersen/R 's/O story/N of/P the/D Little/R Fir/R Tree/R ./O

One/O Christmas/R Day/R ,/O when/O I/Q was/V grown/V up/O ,/O I/Q found/V myself/Q at/P a/D loss/N for/P the/D ``/O one/O more/G ''/O story/N called/V for/P by/P some/D little/G children/N with/P whom/Q I/Q was/V spending/V the/D holiday/N ./O
In/P the/D mental/G search/N for/P buried/G treasure/N which/O ensued/V ,/O I/Q came/V upon/P one/O or/C two/O word-impressions/N of/P the/D experiences/N of/P the/D Little/R Fir/R Tree/R ,/O and/C forthwith/G wove/N them/Q into/P what/Q I/Q supposed/V to/P be/V something/N of/P a/D reproduction/N of/P the/D original/G ./O
The/D latter/G part/N of/P the/D story/N had/V wholly/A faded/V from/P my/Q memory/N ,/O so/P that/P I/Q ``/O made/V up/O ''/O to/P suit/V the/D tastes/N of/P my/Q audience/N ./O
Afterward/A I/Q told/V the/D story/N to/P a/D good/G many/G children/N ,/O at/P one/O time/N or/C another/D ,/O and/C it/Q gradually/A took/V the/D shape/N it/Q has/V here/A ./O

Then/A indeed/A I/Q was/V amused/V ,/O and/C somewhat/A distressed/G ,/O to/P find/V how/O far/A I/Q had/V wandered/V from/P the/D text/N ./O
I/Q give/V this/D explanation/N that/P the/D reader/N may/O know/V I/Q do/V not/A presume/V to/P offer/V the/D little/G tale/N which/O follows/V as/P an/D ``/O adaptation/N ''/O of/P Andersen/R 's/O famous/G story/N ./O
I/Q offer/V it/Q plainly/A as/P a/D story/N which/O children/N have/V liked/V ,/O and/C which/O grew/V out/P of/P my/Q early/G memories/N of/P Andersen/R 's/O _/N The/D Little/R Fir/R Tree/R _/R ./O
Once/A there/A was/V a/D Little/G Fir/R Tree/R ,/O slim/G and/C pointed/G ,/O and/C shiny/N ,/O which/O stood/V in/P the/D great/G forest/N in/P the/D midst/N of/P some/D big/G fir/N trees/N ,/O broad/G ,/O and/C tall/G ,/O and/C shadowy/G green/G ./O
The/D Little/R Fir/R Tree/R was/V very/A unhappy/G because/P he/Q was/V not/A big/G like/P the/D others/N ./O
When/O the/D birds/N came/V flying/V into/P the/D woods/N and/C lit/N on/P the/D branches/N of/P the/D big/G trees/N and/C built/V their/Q nests/N there/A ,/O he/Q used/V to/P call/V up/O to/P them/Q ,/O --/O ``/O Come/V down/O ,/O come/V down/O ,/O rest/N in/P my/Q branches/N !/O ''/O

When/O the/D splendid/G wind/N came/V blowing/V and/C singing/V through/P the/D forest/N ,/O it/Q bent/V and/C rocked/V and/C swung/V the/D tops/N of/P the/D big/G trees/N ,/O and/C murmured/V to/P them/Q ./O
Then/A the/D Little/R Fir/R Tree/R looked/V up/O ,/O and/C called/V ,/O --/O ``/O Oh/O ,/O please/V ,/O dear/G wind/N ,/O come/V down/A and/C play/V with/P me/Q !/O ''/O

In/P the/D winter/N the/D white/G snow/N fell/V softly/A ,/O softly/A ,/O and/C covered/V the/D great/G trees/N all/D over/A with/P wonderful/G caps/N and/C coats/N of/P white/G ./O

``/O There/O are/V none/N little/A enough/A ,/O ''/O they/Q said/V ./O

The/D Little/R Fir/R Tree/R was/V happy/G as/P a/D bird/N ,/O because/P he/Q knew/V they/Q were/V about/A to/P cut/V him/Q down/O ./O

For/P they/Q hoped/V that/P the/D hardship/N would/O kill/V off/O the/D Israelites/R ./O

He/Q ordered/V his/Q soldiers/N to/P kill/V every/D boy/N baby/N that/O should/O be/V born/V in/P an/D Israelitish/G family/N ;/O he/Q did/V not/A care/V about/P the/D girls/N ,/O because/P they/Q could/O not/A grow/V up/P to/P fight/V ./O
Very/A soon/A after/P this/D wicked/G order/N ,/O a/D boy/N baby/N was/V born/V in/P a/D certain/G Israelitish/G family/N ./O

She/Q had/V been/V thinking/V all/D this/D time/N about/P what/Q she/Q should/O do/V ,/O and/C now/A she/Q carried/V out/O her/Q plan/N ./O
First/A ,/O she/Q took/V a/D basket/N made/V of/P bulrushes/N and/C daubed/V it/Q all/D over/A with/P pitch/N ,/O so/P that/P it/Q was/V water-tight/G ,/O and/C then/A she/Q laid/V the/D baby/N in/P it/Q ;/O then/A she/Q carried/V it/Q to/P the/D edge/N of/P the/D river/N and/C laid/V it/Q in/P the/D flags/N by/P the/D river/N 's/O brink/N ./O
It/Q did/V not/A show/V at/P all/D ,/O unless/P one/O were/V quite/A near/P it/Q ./O
Then/A she/Q kissed/V her/Q little/G son/N and/C left/V him/Q there/A ./O
But/C his/Q sister/N stood/V far/A off/O ,/O not/A seeming/V to/P watch/V ,/O but/C really/A watching/V carefully/A to/P see/V what/Q would/O happen/V to/P the/D baby/N ./O
Soon/A there/A was/V the/D sound/N of/P talk/N and/C laughter/N ,/O and/C a/D train/N of/P beautiful/G women/N came/V down/A to/P the/D water/N 's/O edge/N ./O
It/Q was/V the/D king/N 's/O daughter/N ,/O come/V down/O to/P bathe/N in/P the/D river/N ,/O with/P her/Q maidens/N ./O
The/D maidens/N walked/V along/A by/P the/D river/N side/N ./O
As/P the/D king/N 's/O daughter/N came/V near/P to/P the/D water/N ,/O she/Q saw/V the/D strange/G little/G basket/N lying/V in/P the/D flags/N ,/O and/C she/Q sent/V her/Q maid/N to/P bring/V it/Q to/P her/Q ./O
And/C when/O she/Q had/V opened/V it/Q ,/O she/Q saw/V the/D child/N ;/O the/D poor/G baby/N was/V crying/V ./O
When/O she/Q saw/V him/Q ,/O so/P helpless/G and/C so/A beautiful/G ,/O crying/V for/P his/Q mother/N ,/O the/D king/N 's/O daughter/N pitied/V him/Q and/C loved/V him/Q ./O
She/Q knew/V the/D cruel/G order/N of/P her/Q father/N ,/O and/C she/Q said/V at/P once/A ,/O ``/O This/D is/V one/O of/P the/D Hebrews/N '/O children/N ./O ''/O
At/P that/D moment/N the/D baby/N 's/O sister/N came/V to/P the/D princess/N and/C said/V ,/O ``/O Shall/R I/Q go/V and/C find/V thee/V a/D nurse/N from/P the/D Hebrew/R women/N ,/O so/P that/P she/Q may/O nurse/N the/D child/N for/P thee/N ?/O ''/O
Not/A a/D word/N did/V she/Q say/V about/A whose/Q child/N it/Q was/V ,/O but/C perhaps/A the/D princess/N guessed/V ;/O I/Q do/V n't/A know/V ./O
At/P all/D events/N ,/O she/Q told/V the/D little/G girl/N to/P go/V ./O
So/P the/D maiden/N went/V ,/O and/C brought/V her/Q mother/N !/O
Then/A the/D king/N 's/O daughter/N said/V to/P the/D baby/N 's/O mother/N ,/O ``/O Take/V this/D child/N away/A and/C nurse/N it/Q for/P me/Q ,/O and/C I/Q will/O give/V thee/D wages/N ./O ''/O

And/C can/O you/Q think/V how/O happy/G the/D baby/N 's/O mother/N was/V ?/O
For/P now/A the/D baby/N would/O be/V known/V only/A as/P the/D princess/N 's/O adopted/V child/N ,/O and/C would/O be/V safe/G ./O
And/C it/Q was/V so./R ./O
The/D mother/N kept/V him/Q until/P he/Q was/V old/G enough/A to/P be/V taken/V to/P the/D princess/N 's/O palace/N ./O
Then/A he/Q was/V brought/V and/C given/V to/P the/D king/N 's/O daughter/N ,/O and/C he/Q became/V her/Q son/N ./O
And/C she/Q named/V him/Q Moses/R ./O
But/C the/D strangest/G part/N of/P the/D whole/G story/N is/V ,/O that/P when/O Moses/N grew/V to/P be/V a/D man/N he/Q became/V so/A strong/G and/C wise/G that/P it/Q was/V he/Q who/Q at/P last/G saved/V his/Q people/N from/P the/D king/N and/C rescued/V them/Q from/P the/D Egyptians/N ./O
The/D one/O child/N saved/V by/P the/D king/N 's/O own/G daughter/N was/V the/D very/A one/O the/D king/N would/O most/A have/V wanted/V to/P kill/V ,/O if/P he/Q had/V known/V ./O
THE/D TEN/R FAIRIES/R Once/A upon/P a/D time/N there/A was/V a/D dear/G little/G girl/N ,/O whose/Q name/N was/V Elsa/R ./O
Elsa/R 's/O father/N and/C mother/N worked/V very/A hard/G and/C became/V rich/G ./O
But/C they/Q loved/V Elsa/R so/A much/A that/P they/Q did/V not/A like/P her/Q to/P do/V any/D work/N ;/O very/A foolishly/A ,/O they/Q let/V her/Q play/V all/D the/D time/N ./O
So/A when/O Elsa/R grew/V up/O ,/O she/Q did/V not/A know/V how/O to/P do/V anything/N ;/O she/Q could/O not/A make/V bread/N ,/O she/Q could/O not/A sweep/V a/D room/N ,/O she/Q could/O not/A sew/V a/D seam/N ;/O she/Q could/O only/A laugh/V and/C sing/V ./O

And/C because/P she/Q had/V never/A worked/V at/P all/D it/Q made/V her/Q very/A tired/G even/A to/P try/V ;/O she/Q was/V tired/V before/P the/D morning/N was/V over/A ,/O every/D day/N ./O

Elsa/R 's/O husband/N had/V a/D hard/G time/N of/P it/Q ;/O he/Q had/V only/A poor/G food/N to/P eat/V ,/O and/C it/Q was/V not/A ready/G at/P the/D right/G time/N ,/O and/C the/D house/N looked/V all/D in/P a/D muddle/N ./O

At/P last/G ,/O one/O day/N ,/O Elsa/R 's/O husband/N went/V away/A quite/A cross/V ;/O he/Q said/V to/P her/Q ,/O as/P he/Q went/V out/P of/P the/D door/N ,/O ``/O It/Q is/V no/D wonder/N that/P the/D house/N looks/V so/A ,/O when/O you/Q sit/V all/D day/N with/P your/Q hands/N in/P your/Q lap/N !/O ''/O

A/D brave/G little/G company/N of/P pioneers/N from/P the/D Atlantic/R coast/N crossed/V the/D Mississippi/R River/R and/C journeyed/V across/P the/D plains/N of/P Central/R North/R America/R in/P big/G covered/G wagons/N with/P many/G horses/N ,/O and/C finally/A succeeded/V in/P climbing/V to/P the/D top/N of/P the/D great/G Rockies/R and/C down/A again/A into/P a/D valley/N in/P the/D very/G midst/N of/P the/D mountains/N ./O
It/Q was/V a/D valley/N of/P brown/G ,/O bare/G ,/O desert/N soil/N ,/O in/P a/D climate/N where/O almost/A no/D rain/N falls/V ;/O but/C the/D snow/N on/P the/D mountain-tops/N sent/V down/O little/G streams/N of/P pure/G water/N ,/O the/D winds/N were/V gentle/G ,/O and/C lying/V like/P a/D blue/G jewel/N at/P the/D foot/N of/P the/D western/G hills/N was/V a/D marvellous/G lake/N of/P salt/N water/N ,/O --/O an/D inland/N sea/N ./O

All/D their/Q lives/N now/A depended/V on/P the/D crops/N of/P grain/N and/C vegetables/N which/O they/Q could/O raise/V in/P the/D valley/N ./O

MARGARET/N OF/P NEW/G ORLEANS/N If/P you/Q ever/A go/V to/P the/D beautiful/G city/N of/P New/R Orleans/R ,/O somebody/N will/O be/V sure/G to/P take/V you/Q down/A into/P the/D old/G business/N part/N of/P the/D city/N ,/O where/O there/O are/V banks/N and/C shops/N and/C hotels/N ,/O and/C show/V you/Q a/D statue/N which/O stands/V in/P a/D little/G square/N there/A ./O

This/D is/V her/Q story/N ,/O and/C it/Q tells/V why/O people/N made/V a/D monument/N for/P her/Q ./O
When/O Margaret/R was/V a/D tiny/G baby/N ,/O her/Q father/N and/C mother/N died/V ,/O and/C she/Q was/V adopted/V by/P two/O young/G people/N as/P poor/G and/C as/A kind/N as/P her/Q own/G parents/N ./O

Then/A she/Q married/G ,/O and/C had/V a/D little/G baby/N of/P her/Q own/G ./O
But/C very/A soon/A her/Q husband/N died/V ,/O and/C then/A the/D baby/N died/V ,/O too/A ,/O and/C Margaret/R was/V all/D alone/A in/P the/D world/N ./O
She/Q was/V poor/G ,/O but/C she/Q was/V strong/G ,/O and/C knew/V how/O to/P work/V ./O
All/D day/N ,/O from/P morning/N until/P evening/N ,/O she/Q ironed/V clothes/N in/P a/D laundry/N ./O
And/C every/D day/N ,/O as/P she/Q worked/V by/P the/D window/N ,/O she/Q saw/V the/D little/G motherless/G children/N from/P the/D orphan/N asylum/N ,/O near/G by/P ,/O working/V and/C playing/V about/A ./O
After/P a/D while/N ,/O there/O came/V a/D great/G sickness/N upon/P the/D city/N ,/O and/C so/A many/G mothers/N and/C fathers/N died/V that/P there/O were/V more/G orphans/N than/P the/D asylum/N could/O possibly/A take/V care/N of/P ./O
They/Q needed/V a/D good/G friend/N ,/O now/A ./O
You/Q would/O hardly/A think/V ,/O would/O you/Q ,/O that/P a/D poor/G woman/N who/Q worked/V in/P a/D laundry/N could/O be/V much/A of/P a/D friend/N to/P them/Q ?/O
But/C Margaret/R was/V ./O
She/Q went/V straight/A to/P the/D kind/N Sisters/N who/Q had/V the/D asylum/N and/C told/V them/Q she/Q was/V going/V to/P give/V them/Q part/N of/P her/Q wages/N and/C was/V going/V to/P work/V for/P them/Q ,/O besides/P ./O
Pretty/R soon/A she/Q had/V worked/V so/A hard/A that/P she/Q had/V some/D money/N saved/V from/P her/Q wages/N ./O
With/P this/D ,/O she/Q bought/V two/O cows/N and/C a/D little/G delivery/N cart/N ./O
Then/A she/Q carried/V her/Q milk/N to/P her/Q customers/N in/P the/D little/G cart/N every/D morning/N ;/O and/C as/P she/Q went/V ,/O she/Q begged/V the/D pieces/N of/P food/N left/V over/O from/P the/D hotels/N and/C rich/G houses/N ,/O and/C brought/V it/Q back/A in/P the/D cart/N to/P the/D hungry/G children/N in/P the/D asylum/N ./O
In/P the/D very/A hardest/G times/N that/O was/V often/A all/D the/D food/N the/D poor/G children/N had/V ./O
A/D part/N of/P the/D money/N Margaret/R earned/V went/V every/D week/N to/P the/D asylum/N ,/O and/C after/P a/D few/G years/N that/O was/V made/V very/A much/A larger/G and/C better/G ./O
Margaret/R was/V so/A careful/G and/C so/A good/G at/P business/N that/P ,/O in/P spite/N of/P her/Q giving/V ,/O she/Q bought/V more/G cows/N and/C earned/V more/G money/N ./O
With/P this/D ,/O she/Q built/V a/D home/N for/P orphan/N babies/N ;/O she/Q called/V it/Q her/Q baby/N house/N ./O
After/P a/D time/N ,/O Margaret/R had/V a/D chance/N to/P get/V a/D bakery/N ,/O and/C then/A she/Q became/V a/D bread-woman/N instead/A of/P a/D milk-woman/N ./O
She/Q carried/V the/D bread/N just/A as/P she/Q had/V carried/V the/D milk/N ,/O in/P her/Q cart/N ./O
And/C still/A she/Q kept/V giving/V money/N to/P the/D asylum/N ./O
Then/A the/D great/G war/N came/V ,/O the/D Civil/R War/R ./O
In/P all/D the/D trouble/N and/C sickness/N and/C fear/N of/P that/D time/N ,/O Margaret/R drove/V her/Q cart/N of/P bread/N ;/O and/C somehow/A she/Q had/V always/A enough/A to/P give/V the/D starving/V soldiers/N ,/O and/C for/P her/Q babies/N ,/O beside/P what/Q she/Q sold/V ./O
And/C despite/P all/D this/D ,/O she/Q earned/V enough/A so/A that/P when/O the/D war/N was/V over/P she/Q built/V a/D big/G steam/N factory/N for/P her/Q bread/N ./O
By/P this/D time/N everybody/N in/P the/D city/N knew/V her/Q ./O
The/D children/N all/D over/P the/D city/N loved/V her/Q ;/O the/D business/N men/N were/V proud/G of/P her/Q ;/O the/D poor/G people/N all/D came/V to/P her/Q for/P advice/N ./O
She/Q used/V to/P sit/V at/P the/D open/G door/N of/P her/Q office/N ,/O in/P a/D calico/N gown/N and/C a/D little/G shawl/N ,/O and/C give/V a/D good/G word/N to/P everybody/N ,/O rich/G or/C poor/G ./O
Then/A ,/O by/P and/C by/P ,/O one/O day/N ,/O Margaret/R died/V ./O
And/C when/O it/Q was/V time/N to/P read/V her/Q will/O ,/O the/D people/N found/V that/P ,/O with/P all/D her/Q giving/V ,/O she/Q had/V still/A saved/V a/D great/G deal/N of/P money/N ,/O and/C that/P she/Q had/V left/V every/D penny/N of/P it/Q to/P the/D different/G orphan/N asylums/N of/P the/D city/N ,/O --/O each/D one/O of/P them/Q was/V given/V something/N ./O
Whether/P they/Q were/V for/P white/G children/N or/C black/G ,/O for/P Jews/R ,/O Catholics/R ,/O or/C Protestants/N ,/O made/V no/D difference/N ;/O for/P Margaret/R always/A said/V ,/O ``/O They/Q are/V all/D orphans/N alike/A ./O ''/O
And/C just/A think/V ,/O dears/N ,/O that/P splendid/G ,/O wise/G will/N was/V signed/V with/P a/D cross/N instead/A of/P a/D name/N ,/O for/P Margaret/R had/V never/A learned/V to/P read/V or/C write/V !/O
When/O the/D people/N of/P New/R Orleans/R knew/V that/P Margaret/R was/V dead/G ,/O they/Q said/V ,/O ``/O She/Q was/V a/D mother/N to/P the/D motherless/N ;/O she/Q was/V a/D friend/N to/P those/D who/Q had/V no/D friends/N ;/O she/Q had/V wisdom/N greater/G than/P schools/N can/O teach/V ;/O we/Q will/O not/A let/V her/Q memory/N go/V from/P us/Q ./O ''/O
So/P they/Q made/V a/D statue/N of/P her/Q ,/O just/A as/P she/Q used/V to/P look/V ,/O sitting/V in/P her/Q own/G office/N door/N ,/O or/C driving/V in/P her/Q own/G little/G cart/N ./O

One/O of/P the/D prettiest/G legends/N is/V the/D story/N I/Q am/V going/V to/P tell/V you/Q about/P the/D Dagda/R 's/O harp/G ./O
It/Q is/V said/V that/P there/O were/V two/O quite/A different/G kinds/N of/P people/N in/P Ireland/R :/O one/O set/N of/P people/N with/P long/G dark/G hair/N and/C dark/G eyes/N ,/O called/V Fomorians/N --/O they/Q carried/V long/A slender/G spears/N made/V of/P golden/G bronze/N when/O they/Q fought/V --/O and/C another/D race/N of/P people/N who/Q were/V golden-haired/G and/C blue-eyed/G ,/O and/C who/Q carried/V short/A ,/O blunt/G ,/O heavy/G spears/N of/P dull/G metal/N ./O
The/D golden-haired/G people/N had/V a/D great/G chieftain/N who/Q was/V also/A a/D kind/N of/P high/G priest/N ,/O who/Q was/V called/V the/D Dagda/R ./O
And/C this/D Dagda/R had/V a/D wonderful/G magic/G harp/G ./O
The/D harp/G was/V beautiful/G to/P look/V upon/P ,/O mighty/A in/P size/N ,/O made/V of/P rare/G wood/N ,/O and/C ornamented/G with/P gold/N and/C jewels/N ;/O and/C it/Q had/V wonderful/G music/N in/P its/Q strings/N ,/O which/O only/A the/D Dagda/R could/O call/V out/O ./O
When/O the/D men/N were/V going/V out/O to/P battle/V ,/O the/D Dagda/R would/O set/V up/O his/Q magic/G harp/G and/C sweep/N his/Q hand/N across/P the/D strings/N ,/O and/C a/D war/N song/N would/O ring/V out/O which/O would/O make/V every/D warrior/G buckle/N on/P his/Q armour/N ,/O brace/N his/Q knees/N ,/O and/C shout/N ,/O ``/O Forth/R to/P the/D fight/N !/O ''/O
Then/A ,/O when/O the/D men/N came/V back/A from/P the/D battle/N ,/O weary/G and/C wounded/V ,/O the/D Dagda/R would/O take/V his/Q harp/G and/C strike/V a/D few/G chords/N ,/O and/C as/P the/D magic/G music/N stole/V out/O upon/P the/D air/N ,/O every/D man/N forgot/V his/Q weariness/N and/C the/D smart/G of/P his/Q wounds/N ,/O and/C thought/V of/P the/D honour/N he/Q had/V won/V ,/O and/C of/P the/D comrade/N who/Q had/V died/V beside/P him/Q ,/O and/C of/P the/D safety/N of/P his/Q wife/N and/C children/N ./O
Then/A the/D song/N would/O swell/V out/A louder/A ,/O and/C every/D warrior/N would/O remember/V only/A the/D glory/N he/Q had/V helped/V win/V for/P the/D king/N ;/O and/C each/D man/N would/O rise/V at/P the/D great/G table/N ,/O his/Q cup/N in/P his/Q hand/N ,/O and/C shout/V ``/O Long/A live/V the/D King/R !/O ''/O

So/P the/D Giant-Maidens/R waxed/V very/A wroth/G with/P King/R Frode/R ,/O and/C as/P they/Q resumed/V their/Q labours/N they/Q sang/V a/D song/N of/P the/D hardness/N of/P their/Q lot/N in/P the/D household/N of/P this/D pitiless/G King/R ./O

Presently/A ,/O as/P the/D great/G stones/N moved/V round/N and/C round/N ,/O Frode/R ,/O who/Q still/A stood/V by/P ,/O heard/V one/O chant/N in/P a/D low/G ,/O sing-song/G voice/N ,/O --/O ``/O I/Q see/V a/D fire/N east/G of/P the/D town/N --/O the/D curlews/N awake/G and/C sound/G a/D note/N of/P warning/V ./O

THE/D CASTLE/N OF/P FORTUNE/R One/O lovely/G summer/N morning/N ,/O just/A as/A the/D sun/N rose/V ,/O two/O travellers/N started/V on/P a/D journey/N ./O
