A/D cloud/N was/V on/P the/D mind/N of/P men/N ,/O and/C wailing/V went/V the/D weather/N ,/O Yea/R ,/O a/D sick/G cloud/N upon/P the/D soul/N when/O we/Q were/V boys/N together/A ./O
Science/R announced/V nonentity/N and/C art/N admired/V decay/N ;/O The/D world/N was/V old/G and/C ended/V :/O but/C you/Q and/C I/Q were/V gay/G ;/O Round/N us/Q in/P antic/G order/N their/Q crippled/G vices/N came/V --/O Lust/R that/O had/V lost/V its/Q laughter/N ,/O fear/N that/O had/V lost/V its/Q shame/N ./O
Like/P the/D white/G lock/N of/P Whistler/R ,/O that/O lit/V our/Q aimless/G gloom/N ,/O Men/N showed/V their/Q own/G white/G feather/N as/P proudly/A as/P a/D plume/N ./O
Life/R was/V a/D fly/N that/P faded/V ,/O and/C death/N a/D drone/N that/P stung/N ;/O The/D world/N was/V very/A old/G indeed/A when/O you/Q and/C I/Q were/V young/G ./O
They/Q twisted/V even/A decent/G sin/N to/P shapes/N not/A to/P be/V named/V :/O Men/N were/V ashamed/G of/P honour/N ;/O but/C we/Q were/V not/A ashamed/G ./O
Weak/V if/P we/Q were/V and/C foolish/G ,/O not/A thus/A we/Q failed/V ,/O not/A thus/A ;/O When/O that/D black/G Baal/G blocked/V the/D heavens/N he/Q had/V no/D hymns/N from/P us/Q Children/N we/Q were/V --/O our/Q forts/N of/P sand/N were/V even/A as/P weak/G as/P eve/N ,/O High/R as/P they/Q went/V we/Q piled/V them/Q up/O to/P break/V that/P bitter/G sea/N ./O
Fools/N as/P we/Q were/V in/P motley/N ,/O all/D jangling/N and/C absurd/G ,/O When/O all/D church/N bells/N were/V silent/G our/Q cap/N and/C beds/N were/V heard/V ./O
Not/A all/D unhelped/V we/Q held/V the/D fort/N ,/O our/Q tiny/G flags/N unfurled/G ;/O Some/D giants/N laboured/V in/P that/D cloud/N to/P lift/V it/Q from/P the/D world/N ./O
I/Q find/V again/A the/D book/N we/Q found/V ,/O I/Q feel/V the/D hour/N that/P flings/N Far/A out/A of/P fish-shaped/G Paumanok/P some/D cry/N of/P cleaner/G things/N ;/O And/C the/D Green/R Carnation/R withered/V ,/O as/P in/P forest/N fires/N that/P pass/N ,/O Roared/V in/P the/D wind/N of/P all/D the/D world/N ten/O million/O leaves/N of/P grass/N ;/O Or/C sane/N and/C sweet/G and/C sudden/G as/P a/D bird/N sings/V in/P the/D rain/N --/O Truth/R out/P of/P Tusitala/R spoke/V and/C pleasure/N out/P of/P pain/N ./O
Yea/O ,/O cool/G and/C clear/G and/C sudden/G as/P a/D bird/N sings/V in/P the/D grey/R ,/O Dunedin/R to/P Samoa/R spoke/V ,/O and/C darkness/N unto/P day/N ./O
But/C we/Q were/V young/G ;/O we/Q lived/V to/P see/V God/R break/V their/Q bitter/G charms/N ./O
God/R and/C the/D good/G Republic/N come/V riding/V back/A in/P arms/N :/O We/Q have/V seen/V the/D City/R of/P Mansoul/R ,/O even/A as/P it/Q rocked/V ,/O relieved/V --/O Blessed/V are/V they/Q who/Q did/V not/A see/V ,/O but/C being/V blind/G ,/O believed/V ./O
This/D is/V a/D tale/N of/P those/D old/G fears/N ,/O even/A of/P those/D emptied/V hells/N ,/O And/C none/N but/C you/Q shall/O understand/V the/D true/G thing/N that/P it/Q tells/V --/O Of/P what/Q colossal/N gods/N of/P shame/N could/O cow/N men/N and/C yet/A crash/N ,/O Of/P what/Q huge/G devils/N hid/V the/D stars/N ,/O yet/C fell/V at/P a/D pistol/N flash/N ./O
The/D doubts/N that/O were/V so/A plain/G to/P chase/V ,/O so/A dreadful/G to/P withstand/V --/O Oh/O ,/O who/Q shall/O understand/V but/C you/Q ;/O yea/R ,/O who/Q shall/O understand/V ?/O
The/D doubts/N that/O drove/V us/Q through/P the/D night/N as/P we/Q two/O talked/V amain/P ,/O And/C day/N had/V broken/V on/P the/D streets/N e'/P er/N it/Q broke/V upon/P the/D brain/N ./O
Between/P us/Q ,/O by/P the/D peace/N of/P God/R ,/O such/G truth/N can/O now/A be/V told/V ;/O Yea/R ,/O there/O is/V strength/N in/P striking/G root/N and/C good/G in/P growing/V old/G ./O
We/Q have/V found/V common/G things/N at/P last/G and/C marriage/N and/C a/D creed/N ,/O And/C I/Q may/O safely/A write/V it/Q now/A ,/O and/C you/Q may/O safely/A read/V ./O
G./R K./R C./R CHAPTER/N I/Q THE/D TWO/R POETS/R OF/P SAFFRON/R PARK/R THE/D suburb/N of/P Saffron/R Park/R lay/V on/P the/D sunset/G side/N of/P London/R ,/O as/P red/G and/C ragged/G as/P a/D cloud/N of/P sunset/N ./O
It/Q was/V built/V of/P a/D bright/G brick/N throughout/P ;/O its/Q sky-line/N was/V fantastic/G ,/O and/C even/A its/Q ground/N plan/N was/V wild/G ./O
It/Q had/V been/V the/D outburst/N of/P a/D speculative/G builder/N ,/O faintly/A tinged/V with/P art/N ,/O who/Q called/V its/Q architecture/N sometimes/A Elizabethan/P and/C sometimes/A Queen/R Anne/R ,/O apparently/A under/P the/D impression/N that/P the/D two/O sovereigns/N were/V identical/G ./O
It/Q was/V described/V with/P some/D justice/N as/P an/D artistic/G colony/N ,/O though/P it/Q never/A in/P any/D definable/G way/N produced/V any/D art/N ./O
But/C although/P its/Q pretensions/N to/P be/V an/D intellectual/G centre/N were/V a/D little/G vague/G ,/O its/Q pretensions/N to/P be/V a/D pleasant/G place/N were/V quite/A indisputable/G ./O
The/D stranger/N who/Q looked/V for/P the/D first/G time/N at/P the/D quaint/G red/G houses/N could/O only/A think/V how/O very/A oddly/A shaped/V the/D people/N must/O be/V who/Q could/O fit/V in/P to/P them/Q ./O
Nor/C when/O he/Q met/V the/D people/N was/V he/Q disappointed/V in/P this/D respect/N ./O
The/D place/N was/V not/A only/A pleasant/G ,/O but/C perfect/G ,/O if/P once/A he/Q could/O regard/V it/Q not/A as/P a/D deception/N but/C rather/A as/P a/D dream/N ./O
Even/A if/P the/D people/N were/V not/A ``/O artists/N ,/O ''/O the/D whole/N was/V nevertheless/A artistic/G ./O
That/D young/G man/N with/P the/D long/G ,/O auburn/G hair/N and/C the/D impudent/G face/N --/O that/P young/G man/N was/V not/A really/A a/D poet/N ;/O but/C surely/A he/Q was/V a/D poem/N ./O
That/D old/G gentleman/N with/P the/D wild/G ,/O white/G beard/N and/C the/D wild/G ,/O white/G hat/N --/O that/D venerable/G humbug/N was/V not/A really/A a/D philosopher/N ;/O but/C at/P least/G he/Q was/V the/D cause/N of/P philosophy/N in/P others/N ./O
That/D scientific/G gentleman/N with/P the/D bald/G ,/O egg-like/G head/N and/C the/D bare/G ,/O bird-like/G neck/N had/V no/D real/G right/N to/P the/D airs/N of/P science/N that/P he/Q assumed/V ./O
He/Q had/V not/A discovered/V anything/N new/G in/P biology/N ;/O but/C what/Q biological/G creature/N could/O he/Q have/V discovered/V more/G singular/G than/P himself/Q ?/O
Thus/A ,/O and/C thus/A only/A ,/O the/D whole/G place/N had/V properly/A to/P be/V regarded/V ;/O it/Q had/V to/P be/V considered/V not/A so/A much/G as/P a/D workshop/N for/P artists/N ,/O but/C as/P a/D frail/G but/C finished/V work/N of/P art/N ./O
A/D man/N who/Q stepped/V into/P its/Q social/G atmosphere/N felt/V as/P if/P he/Q had/V stepped/V into/P a/D written/V comedy/N ./O
More/G especially/A this/D attractive/G unreality/N fell/V upon/P it/Q about/P nightfall/N ,/O when/O the/D extravagant/G roofs/N were/V dark/G against/P the/D afterglow/G and/C the/D whole/G insane/G village/N seemed/V as/P separate/G as/P a/D drifting/V cloud/N ./O
This/D again/A was/V more/A strongly/A true/G of/P the/D many/G nights/N of/P local/G festivity/N ,/O when/O the/D little/G gardens/N were/V often/A illuminated/V ,/O and/C the/D big/G Chinese/G lanterns/N glowed/V in/P the/D dwarfish/N trees/N like/P some/D fierce/G and/C monstrous/G fruit/N ./O
And/C this/D was/V strongest/G of/P all/D on/P one/O particular/G evening/N ,/O still/A vaguely/A remembered/V in/P the/D locality/N ,/O of/P which/O the/D auburn-haired/G poet/N was/V the/D hero/N ./O
It/Q was/V not/A by/P any/D means/V the/D only/G evening/N of/P which/O he/Q was/V the/D hero/N ./O
On/P many/G nights/N those/D passing/N by/P his/Q little/G back/G garden/N might/O hear/V his/Q high/G ,/O didactic/G voice/N laying/V down/O the/D law/N to/P men/N and/C particularly/A to/P women/N ./O
The/D attitude/N of/P women/N in/P such/G cases/N was/V indeed/A one/O of/P the/D paradoxes/N of/P the/D place/N ./O
Most/G of/P the/D women/N were/V of/P the/D kind/N vaguely/A called/V emancipated/V ,/O and/C professed/V some/D protest/N against/P male/N supremacy/N ./O
Yet/A these/D new/G women/N would/O always/A pay/V to/P a/D man/N the/D extravagant/G compliment/N which/O no/A ordinary/G woman/N ever/A pays/V to/P him/Q ,/O that/P of/P listening/V while/P he/Q is/V talking/V ./O
And/C Mr./R Lucian/R Gregory/R ,/O the/D red-haired/G poet/N ,/O was/V really/A (/O in/P some/D sense/N )/O a/D man/N worth/G listening/V to/P ,/O even/A if/P one/O only/A laughed/V at/P the/D end/N of/P it/Q ./O
He/Q put/V the/D old/G cant/N of/P the/D lawlessness/N of/P art/N and/C the/D art/N of/P lawlessness/N with/P a/D certain/G impudent/N freshness/N which/O gave/V at/P least/G a/D momentary/G pleasure/N ./O
He/Q was/V helped/V in/P some/D degree/N by/P the/D arresting/N oddity/N of/P his/Q appearance/N ,/O which/O he/Q worked/V ,/O as/P the/D phrase/N goes/V ,/O for/P all/D it/Q was/V worth/G ./O
His/Q dark/G red/G hair/N parted/V in/P the/D middle/N was/V literally/A like/P a/D woman/N 's/O ,/O and/C curved/V into/P the/D slow/G curls/N of/P a/D virgin/N in/P a/D pre-Raphaelite/G picture/N ./O
From/P within/P this/D almost/A saintly/A oval/N ,/O however/A ,/O his/Q face/N projected/V suddenly/A broad/G and/C brutal/G ,/O the/D chin/N carried/V forward/A with/P a/D look/N of/P cockney/N contempt/N ./O
This/D combination/N at/P once/A tickled/V and/C terrified/V the/D nerves/N of/P a/D neurotic/G population/N ./O
He/Q seemed/V like/P a/D walking/N blasphemy/N ,/O a/D blend/N of/P the/D angel/N and/C the/D ape/N ./O
This/D particular/G evening/N ,/O if/P it/Q is/V remembered/V for/P nothing/N else/A ,/O will/O be/V remembered/V in/P that/D place/N for/P its/Q strange/G sunset/N ./O
It/Q looked/V like/P the/D end/N of/P the/D world/N ./O
All/D the/D heaven/N seemed/V covered/V with/P a/D quite/A vivid/G and/C palpable/G plumage/N ;/O you/Q could/O only/A say/V that/P the/D sky/N was/V full/G of/P feathers/N ,/O and/C of/P feathers/N that/O almost/A brushed/V the/D face/N ./O
Across/P the/D great/G part/N of/P the/D dome/N they/Q were/V grey/A ,/O with/P the/D strangest/N tints/N of/P violet/N and/C mauve/N and/C an/D unnatural/G pink/N or/C pale/G green/G ;/O but/C towards/P the/D west/N the/D whole/N grew/V past/G description/N ,/O transparent/G and/C passionate/G ,/O and/C the/D last/G red-hot/G plumes/N of/P it/Q covered/V up/A the/D sun/N like/P something/N too/A good/G to/P be/V seen/V ./O
The/D whole/N was/V so/A close/G about/P the/D earth/N ,/O as/P to/P express/V nothing/N but/C a/D violent/G secrecy/N ./O
The/D very/A empyrean/G seemed/V to/P be/V a/D secret/G ./O
It/Q expressed/V that/P splendid/G smallness/N which/O is/V the/D soul/N of/P local/G patriotism/N ./O
The/D very/G sky/N seemed/V small/G ./O
I/Q say/V that/P there/O are/V some/D inhabitants/N who/Q may/O remember/V the/D evening/N if/P only/A by/P that/D oppressive/G sky/N ./O
There/O are/V others/N who/Q may/O remember/V it/Q because/P it/Q marked/V the/D first/G appearance/N in/P the/D place/N of/P the/D second/G poet/N of/P Saffron/R Park/R ./O
For/P a/D long/G time/N the/D red-haired/G revolutionary/N had/V reigned/V without/P a/D rival/N ;/O it/Q was/V upon/P the/D night/N of/P the/D sunset/N that/P his/Q solitude/N suddenly/A ended/V ./O
The/D new/G poet/N ,/O who/Q introduced/V himself/Q by/P the/D name/N of/P Gabriel/R Syme/R was/V a/D very/A mild-looking/G mortal/N ,/O with/P a/D fair/G ,/O pointed/G beard/N and/C faint/G ,/O yellow/G hair/N ./O
But/C an/D impression/N grew/V that/P he/Q was/V less/G meek/N than/P he/Q looked/V ./O
He/Q signalised/V his/Q entrance/N by/P differing/V with/P the/D established/V poet/N ,/O Gregory/R ,/O upon/P the/D whole/G nature/N of/P poetry/N ./O
He/Q said/V that/P he/Q (/O Syme/R )/O was/V poet/N of/P law/N ,/O a/D poet/N of/P order/N ;/O nay/N ,/O he/Q said/V he/Q was/V a/D poet/N of/P respectability/N ./O
So/A all/D the/D Saffron/R Parkers/R looked/V at/P him/Q as/P if/P he/Q had/V that/D moment/N fallen/V out/P of/P that/D impossible/G sky/N ./O
In/P fact/N ,/O Mr./R Lucian/R Gregory/R ,/O the/D anarchic/G poet/N ,/O connected/V the/D two/O events/N ./O
``/O It/Q may/O well/A be/V ,/O ''/O he/Q said/V ,/O in/P his/Q sudden/G lyrical/G manner/N ,/O ``/O it/Q may/O well/A be/V on/P such/G a/D night/N of/P clouds/N and/C cruel/G colours/N that/P there/O is/V brought/V forth/O upon/P the/D earth/N such/G a/D portent/N as/P a/D respectable/G poet/N ./O

To/P Syme/R 's/O exaggerative/G mind/N the/D bright/G ,/O bleak/G houses/N and/C terraces/N by/P the/D Thames/R looked/V as/A empty/G as/P the/D mountains/N of/P the/D moon/N ./O

The/D tug/N was/V worked/V by/P two/O men/N ,/O and/C with/P much/G toil/N went/V comparatively/A slowly/A ./O

CHAPTER/N V/R THE/D FEAST/N OF/P FEAR/N AT/O first/A the/D large/G stone/N stair/N seemed/V to/P Syme/V as/A deserted/V as/P a/D pyramid/N ;/O but/C before/P he/Q reached/V the/D top/N he/Q had/V realised/V that/P there/O was/V a/D man/N leaning/V over/P the/D parapet/N of/P the/D Embankment/R and/C looking/V out/O across/P the/D river/N ./O
As/P a/D figure/N he/Q was/V quite/A conventional/G ,/O clad/G in/P a/D silk/N hat/N and/C frock-coat/N of/P the/D more/A formal/G type/N of/P fashion/N ;/O he/Q had/V a/D red/G flower/N in/P his/Q buttonhole/N ./O
As/P Syme/R drew/V nearer/P to/P him/Q step/V by/P step/N ,/O he/Q did/V not/A even/A move/V a/D hair/N ;/O and/C Syme/R could/O come/V close/A enough/A to/P notice/V even/A in/P the/D dim/G ,/O pale/G morning/N light/N that/P his/Q face/N was/V long/A ,/O pale/G and/C intellectual/G ,/O and/C ended/V in/P a/D small/G triangular/G tuft/N of/P dark/G beard/N at/P the/D very/G point/N of/P the/D chin/N ,/O all/D else/A being/V clean-shaven/G ./O
This/D scrap/N of/P hair/N almost/A seemed/V a/D mere/G oversight/N ;/O the/D rest/N of/P the/D face/N was/V of/P the/D type/N that/O is/V best/G shaven/N --/O clear-cut/G ,/O ascetic/G ,/O and/C in/P its/Q way/N noble/G ./O
Syme/R drew/V closer/A and/C closer/A ,/O noting/V all/D this/D ,/O and/C still/A the/D figure/N did/V not/A stir/V ./O
At/P first/G an/D instinct/N had/V told/V Syme/R that/P this/D was/V the/D man/N whom/Q he/Q was/V meant/V to/P meet/V ./O
Then/A ,/O seeing/V that/P the/D man/N made/V no/D sign/N ,/O he/Q had/V concluded/V that/P he/Q was/V not/A ./O
And/C now/A again/A he/Q had/V come/V back/A to/P a/D certainty/N that/P the/D man/N had/V something/N to/P do/V with/P his/Q mad/G adventure/N ./O
For/P the/D man/N remained/V more/G still/A than/P would/O have/V been/V natural/G if/P a/D stranger/N had/V come/V so/A close/A ./O
He/Q was/V as/A motionless/G as/P a/D wax-work/N ,/O and/C got/V on/P the/D nerves/N somewhat/A in/P the/D same/G way/N ./O
Syme/R looked/V again/A and/C again/A at/P the/D pale/G ,/O dignified/G and/C delicate/G face/N ,/O and/C the/D face/N still/A looked/V blankly/A across/P the/D river/N ./O
Then/A he/Q took/V out/O of/P his/Q pocket/N the/D note/N from/P Buttons/N proving/V his/Q election/N ,/O and/C put/V it/Q before/P that/D sad/G and/C beautiful/G face/N ./O
Then/A the/D man/N smiled/V ,/O and/C his/Q smile/N was/V a/D shock/N ,/O for/P it/Q was/V all/D on/P one/O side/N ,/O going/V up/O in/P the/D right/N cheek/N and/C down/A in/P the/D left/N ./O
There/O was/V nothing/N ,/O rationally/A speaking/V ,/O to/P scare/V anyone/N about/P this/D ./O
Many/G people/N have/V this/D nervous/G trick/N of/P a/D crooked/G smile/N ,/O and/C in/P many/G it/Q is/V even/A attractive/G ./O
But/C in/P all/D Syme/R 's/O circumstances/N ,/O with/P the/D dark/G dawn/N and/C the/D deadly/G errand/N and/C the/D loneliness/N on/P the/D great/G dripping/V stones/N ,/O there/O was/V something/N unnerving/V in/P it/Q ./O
There/O was/V the/D silent/G river/N and/C the/D silent/G man/N ,/O a/D man/N of/P even/A classic/G face/N ./O

The/D spasm/N of/P smile/N was/V instantaneous/G ,/O and/C the/D man/N 's/O face/N dropped/V at/P once/A into/P its/Q harmonious/G melancholy/N ./O

In/P the/D wall/N there/A was/V one/O large/G French/G window/N ,/O probably/A the/D window/N of/P a/D large/G coffee-room/N ;/O and/C outside/P this/D window/N ,/O almost/A literally/A overhanging/V the/D square/N ,/O was/V a/D formidably/A buttressed/V balcony/N ,/O big/G enough/A to/P contain/V a/D dining-table/G ./O
In/P fact/N ,/O it/Q did/V contain/V a/D dining-table/G ,/O or/C more/G strictly/A a/D breakfast-table/G ;/O and/C round/V the/D breakfast-table/G ,/O glowing/V in/P the/D sunlight/N and/C evident/G to/P the/D street/N ,/O were/V a/D group/N of/P noisy/G and/C talkative/G men/N ,/O all/D dressed/V in/P the/D insolence/N of/P fashion/N ,/O with/P white/G waistcoats/N and/C expensive/G button-holes/N ./O
Some/D of/P their/Q jokes/N could/O almost/A be/V heard/V across/P the/D square/N ./O
Then/A the/D grave/G Secretary/R gave/V his/Q unnatural/G smile/N ,/O and/C Syme/R knew/V that/P this/D boisterous/G breakfast/N party/N was/V the/D secret/G conclave/N of/P the/D European/G Dynamiters/N ./O
Then/A ,/O as/P Syme/R continued/V to/P stare/V at/P them/Q ,/O he/Q saw/V something/N that/P he/Q had/V not/A seen/V before/P ./O
He/Q had/V not/A seen/V it/Q literally/A because/P it/Q was/V too/A large/G to/P see/V ./O
At/P the/D nearest/G end/N of/P the/D balcony/N ,/O blocking/V up/O a/D great/G part/N of/P the/D perspective/N ,/O was/V the/D back/N of/P a/D great/G mountain/N of/P a/D man/N ./O
When/O Syme/R had/V seen/V him/Q ,/O his/Q first/G thought/N was/V that/P the/D weight/N of/P him/Q must/O break/V down/O the/D balcony/N of/P stone/N ./O
His/Q vastness/N did/V not/A lie/V only/A in/P the/D fact/N that/P he/Q was/V abnormally/A tall/G and/C quite/A incredibly/A fat/G ./O
This/D man/N was/V planned/V enormously/A in/P his/Q original/G proportions/N ,/O like/P a/D statue/N carved/V deliberately/A as/P colossal/N ./O
His/Q head/N ,/O crowned/V with/P white/G hair/N ,/O as/P seen/V from/P behind/N looked/V bigger/G than/P a/D head/N ought/O to/P be/V ./O
The/D ears/N that/O stood/V out/O from/P it/Q looked/V larger/G than/P human/G ears/N ./O
He/Q was/V enlarged/V terribly/A to/P scale/N ;/O and/C this/D sense/N of/P size/N was/V so/A staggering/G ,/O that/P when/O Syme/R saw/V him/Q all/D the/D other/G figures/N seemed/V quite/A suddenly/A to/P dwindle/V and/C become/V dwarfish/N ./O
They/Q were/V still/A sitting/V there/A as/P before/A with/P their/Q flowers/N and/C frock-coats/N ,/O but/C now/A it/Q looked/V as/P if/P the/D big/G man/N was/V entertaining/G five/O children/N to/P tea/N ./O
As/P Syme/R and/C the/D guide/N approached/V the/D side/N door/N of/P the/D hotel/N ,/O a/D waiter/N came/V out/O smiling/V with/P every/D tooth/N in/P his/Q head/N ./O
``/O The/D gentlemen/N are/V up/A there/A ,/O sare/N ,/O ''/O he/Q said/V ./O

And/C the/D waiter/N hurried/V away/O with/P a/D napkin/N over/P his/Q arm/N ,/O much/G pleased/G with/P the/D singular/G frivolity/N of/P the/D gentlemen/N upstairs/N ./O
The/D two/O men/N mounted/V the/D stairs/N in/P silence/N ./O
Syme/R had/V never/A thought/V of/P asking/V whether/P the/D monstrous/G man/N who/Q almost/A filled/V and/C broke/V the/D balcony/N was/V the/D great/G President/R of/P whom/Q the/D others/N stood/V in/P awe/N ./O

Utterly/A devoid/G of/P fear/N in/P physical/G dangers/N ,/O he/Q was/V a/D great/G deal/N too/A sensitive/G to/P the/D smell/N of/P spiritual/G evil/G ./O
Twice/A already/A that/P night/A little/G unmeaning/G things/N had/V peeped/V out/O at/P him/Q almost/A pruriently/A ,/O and/C given/V him/Q a/D sense/N of/P drawing/V nearer/P and/C nearer/P to/P the/D head-quarters/N of/P hell/N ./O
And/C this/D sense/N became/V overpowering/V as/P he/Q drew/V nearer/P to/P the/D great/G President/R ./O
The/D form/N it/Q took/V was/V a/D childish/G and/C yet/A hateful/G fancy/N ./O
As/P he/Q walked/V across/P the/D inner/G room/N towards/P the/D balcony/N ,/O the/D large/G face/N of/P Sunday/R grew/V larger/G and/C larger/G ;/O and/C Syme/R was/V gripped/V with/P a/D fear/N that/P when/O he/Q was/V quite/A close/A the/D face/N would/O be/V too/A big/G to/P be/V possible/G ,/O and/C that/P he/Q would/O scream/V aloud/A ./O
He/Q remembered/V that/P as/P a/D child/N he/Q would/O not/A look/V at/P the/D mask/N of/P Memnon/R in/P the/D British/G Museum/R ,/O because/P it/Q was/V a/D face/N ,/O and/C so/A large/G ./O

The/D men/N greeted/V him/Q with/P good-humoured/G raillery/N as/P if/P they/Q had/V always/A known/V him/Q ./O
He/Q sobered/V himself/Q a/D little/G by/P looking/V at/P their/Q conventional/G coats/N and/C solid/G ,/O shining/V coffee-pot/N ;/O then/A he/Q looked/V again/A at/P Sunday/R ./O
His/Q face/N was/V very/A large/G ,/O but/C it/Q was/V still/A possible/G to/P humanity/N ./O
In/P the/D presence/N of/P the/D President/R the/D whole/G company/N looked/V sufficiently/A commonplace/N ;/O nothing/N about/P them/Q caught/V the/D eye/N at/P first/G ,/O except/P that/P by/P the/D President/R 's/O caprice/N they/Q had/V been/V dressed/V up/O with/P a/D festive/G respectability/N ,/O which/O gave/V the/D meal/N the/D look/N of/P a/D wedding/N breakfast/N ./O

He/Q at/P least/G was/V the/D common/G or/C garden/N Dynamiter/N ./O
He/Q wore/V ,/O indeed/A ,/O the/D high/G white/G collar/N and/C satin/N tie/N that/O were/V the/D uniform/N of/P the/D occasion/N ;/O but/C out/P of/P this/D collar/N there/A sprang/V a/D head/N quite/A unmanageable/G and/C quite/A unmistakable/G ,/O a/D bewildering/N bush/N of/P brown/G hair/N and/C beard/N that/P almost/A obscured/G the/D eyes/N like/P those/D of/P a/D Skye/N terrier/N ./O
But/C the/D eyes/N did/V look/V out/P of/P the/D tangle/N ,/O and/C they/Q were/V the/D sad/G eyes/N of/P some/D Russian/G serf/N ./O
The/D effect/N of/P this/D figure/N was/V not/A terrible/G like/P that/D of/P the/D President/R ,/O but/C it/Q had/V every/D diablerie/N that/O can/O come/V from/P the/D utterly/A grotesque/G ./O

While/P this/D stream/N of/P conversation/N continued/V ,/O Syme/R was/V looking/V more/G steadily/A at/P the/D men/N around/P him/Q ./O

But/C now/A that/P Syme/R had/V more/G space/N and/C light/N to/P observe/V him/Q ,/O there/O were/V other/G touches/N ./O

But/C there/O was/V one/O persistent/G thing/N which/O first/A troubled/G Syme/N and/C at/P last/G terrified/G him/Q ./O

When/O the/D President/R 's/O eyes/N were/V on/P him/Q he/Q felt/V as/P if/P he/Q were/V made/V of/P glass/N ./O
He/Q had/V hardly/A the/D shred/G of/P a/D doubt/N that/P in/P some/D silent/G and/C extraordinary/G way/N Sunday/R had/V found/V out/O that/P he/Q was/V a/D spy/N ./O
He/Q looked/V over/P the/D edge/N of/P the/D balcony/N ,/O and/C saw/V a/D policeman/N ,/O standing/V abstractedly/A just/A beneath/P ,/O staring/V at/P the/D bright/G railings/N and/C the/D sunlit/N trees/N ./O
Then/A there/O fell/V upon/P him/Q the/D great/G temptation/N that/O was/V to/P torment/V him/Q for/P many/G days/N ./O
In/P the/D presence/N of/P these/D powerful/G and/C repulsive/G men/N ,/O who/Q were/V the/D princes/N of/P anarchy/N ,/O he/Q had/V almost/A forgotten/V the/D frail/G and/C fanciful/G figure/N of/P the/D poet/N Gregory/R ,/O the/D mere/G aesthete/N of/P anarchism/N ./O
He/Q even/A thought/V of/P him/Q now/A with/P an/D old/G kindness/N ,/O as/P if/P they/Q had/V played/V together/A when/O children/N ./O
But/C he/Q remembered/V that/P he/Q was/V still/A tied/V to/P Gregory/R by/P a/D great/G promise/N ./O

He/Q had/V promised/V not/A to/P jump/V over/P that/D balcony/N and/C speak/V to/P that/D policeman/N ./O
He/Q took/V his/Q cold/G hand/N off/P the/D cold/G stone/N balustrade/N ./O
His/Q soul/N swayed/V in/P a/D vertigo/N of/P moral/G indecision/N ./O
He/Q had/V only/A to/P snap/V the/D thread/N of/P a/D rash/N vow/N made/V to/P a/D villainous/G society/N ,/O and/C all/D his/Q life/N could/O be/V as/A open/G and/C sunny/G as/P the/D square/N beneath/P him/Q ./O
He/Q had/V ,/O on/P the/D other/G hand/N ,/O only/A to/P keep/V his/Q antiquated/G honour/N ,/O and/C be/V delivered/V inch/N by/P inch/N into/P the/D power/N of/P this/D great/G enemy/N of/P mankind/N ,/O whose/Q very/G intellect/N was/V a/D torture-chamber/N ./O
Whenever/O he/Q looked/V down/A into/P the/D square/N he/Q saw/V the/D comfortable/G policeman/N ,/O a/D pillar/N of/P common/G sense/N and/C common/G order/N ./O
Whenever/O he/Q looked/V back/A at/P the/D breakfast-table/G he/Q saw/V the/D President/R still/A quietly/A studying/V him/Q with/P big/G ,/O unbearable/G eyes/N ./O
In/P all/D the/D torrent/N of/P his/Q thought/N there/O were/V two/O thoughts/N that/O never/A crossed/V his/Q mind/N ./O
First/A ,/O it/Q never/A occurred/V to/P him/Q to/P doubt/V that/P the/D President/R and/C his/Q Council/N could/O crush/V him/Q if/P he/Q continued/V to/P stand/V alone/A ./O
The/D place/N might/O be/V public/G ,/O the/D project/N might/O seem/V impossible/G ./O
But/C Sunday/R was/V not/A the/D man/N who/Q would/O carry/V himself/Q thus/A easily/A without/P having/V ,/O somehow/A or/C somewhere/A ,/O set/V open/O his/Q iron/N trap/N ./O
Either/C by/P anonymous/G poison/N or/C sudden/G street/N accident/N ,/O by/P hypnotism/N or/C by/P fire/N from/P hell/N ,/O Sunday/R could/O certainly/A strike/V him/Q ./O
If/P he/Q defied/V the/D man/N he/Q was/V probably/A dead/G ,/O either/A struck/V stiff/G there/A in/P his/Q chair/N or/C long/A afterwards/A as/P by/P an/D innocent/G ailment/N ./O
If/P he/Q called/V in/O the/D police/N promptly/A ,/O arrested/V everyone/N ,/O told/V all/D ,/O and/C set/V against/P them/Q the/D whole/G energy/N of/P England/R ,/O he/Q would/O probably/A escape/V ;/O certainly/A not/A otherwise/A ./O
They/Q were/V a/D balconyful/G of/P gentlemen/N overlooking/V a/D bright/G and/C busy/G square/N ;/O but/C he/Q felt/V no/D more/G safe/G with/P them/Q than/P if/P they/Q had/V been/V a/D boatful/N of/P armed/G pirates/N overlooking/V an/D empty/G sea/N ./O
There/O was/V a/D second/G thought/N that/O never/A came/V to/P him/Q ./O
It/Q never/A occurred/V to/P him/Q to/P be/V spiritually/A won/V over/O to/P the/D enemy/N ./O
Many/G moderns/N ,/O inured/V to/P a/D weak/G worship/N of/P intellect/N and/C force/V ,/O might/O have/V wavered/V in/P their/Q allegiance/N under/P this/D oppression/N of/P a/D great/G personality/N ./O

If/P any/D such/G creature/N be/V conceivable/G ,/O he/Q looked/V ,/O indeed/A ,/O somewhat/A like/P it/Q ,/O with/P his/Q earth-shaking/G abstraction/N ,/O as/P of/P a/D stone/N statue/N walking/N ./O

But/C this/D was/V a/D kind/N of/P modern/G meanness/N to/P which/O Syme/R could/O not/A sink/V even/A in/P his/Q extreme/G morbidity/N ./O
Like/P any/D man/N ,/O he/Q was/V coward/N enough/G to/P fear/V great/G force/N ;/O but/C he/Q was/V not/A quite/A coward/N enough/G to/P admire/V it/Q ./O
The/D men/N were/V eating/V as/P they/Q talked/V ,/O and/C even/A in/P this/D they/Q were/V typical/G ./O

At/P first/G he/Q was/V startled/V to/P find/V these/D great/G roads/N so/P empty/G ,/O as/P if/P a/D pestilence/N had/V swept/V through/P the/D city/N ./O
Then/A he/Q told/V himself/Q that/P some/D degree/N of/P emptiness/N was/V natural/G ;/O first/A because/P the/D snow-storm/N was/V even/A dangerously/A deep/G ,/O and/C secondly/A because/P it/Q was/V Sunday/R ./O

Under/P the/D white/G fog/N of/P snow/N high/A up/A in/P the/D heaven/N the/D whole/G atmosphere/N of/P the/D city/N was/V turned/V to/P a/D very/A queer/G kind/N of/P green/G twilight/N ,/O as/P of/P men/N under/P the/D sea/N ./O
The/D sealed/G and/C sullen/G sunset/N behind/P the/D dark/G dome/N of/P St./R Paul/R 's/O had/V in/P it/Q smoky/O and/C sinister/G colours/N --/O colours/N of/P sickly/G green/G ,/O dead/G red/G or/C decaying/N bronze/N ,/O that/O were/V just/A bright/G enough/A to/P emphasise/V the/D solid/G whiteness/N of/P the/D snow/N ./O

It/Q had/V fallen/V accidentally/A ,/O but/C just/A so/A fallen/G as/P to/P half/D drape/N the/D dome/N from/P its/Q very/A topmost/G point/N ,/O and/C to/P pick/V out/O in/P perfect/G silver/N the/D great/G orb/N and/C the/D cross/N ./O
When/O Syme/R saw/V it/Q he/Q suddenly/A straightened/V himself/Q ,/O and/C made/V with/P his/Q sword-stick/G an/D involuntary/G salute/N ./O
He/Q knew/V that/P that/D evil/G figure/N ,/O his/Q shadow/N ,/O was/V creeping/V quickly/A or/C slowly/A behind/P him/Q ,/O and/C he/Q did/V not/A care/V ./O
It/Q seemed/V a/D symbol/N of/P human/G faith/N and/C valour/N that/P while/P the/D skies/N were/V darkening/V that/P high/G place/N of/P the/D earth/N was/V bright/G ./O
The/D devils/N might/O have/V captured/V heaven/N ,/O but/C they/Q had/V not/A yet/A captured/V the/D cross/N ./O
He/Q had/V a/D new/G impulse/N to/P tear/V out/O the/D secret/N of/P this/D dancing/N ,/O jumping/V and/C pursuing/V paralytic/G ;/O and/C at/P the/D entrance/N of/P the/D court/N as/P it/Q opened/V upon/P the/D Circus/R he/Q turned/V ,/O stick/N in/P hand/N ,/O to/P face/V his/Q pursuer/N ./O
Professor/R de/P Worms/N came/V slowly/A round/P the/D corner/N of/P the/D irregular/G alley/N behind/P him/Q ,/O his/Q unnatural/G form/N outlined/V against/P a/D lonely/G gas-lamp/N ,/O irresistibly/A recalling/V that/P very/A imaginative/G figure/N in/P the/D nursery/N rhymes/N ,/O ``/O the/D crooked/G man/N who/Q went/V a/D crooked/G mile/N ./O ''/O

Syme/R waited/V for/P him/Q as/P St./R George/R waited/V for/P the/D dragon/N ,/O as/P a/D man/N waits/V for/P a/D final/G explanation/N or/C for/P death/N ./O
And/C the/D old/G Professor/R came/V right/A up/A to/P him/Q and/C passed/V him/Q like/P a/D total/G stranger/N ,/O without/P even/A a/D blink/N of/P his/Q mournful/G eyelids/N ./O
There/O was/V something/N in/P this/D silent/G and/C unexpected/G innocence/N that/O left/V Syme/R in/P a/D final/G fury/N ./O
The/D man/N 's/O colourless/G face/N and/C manner/N seemed/V to/P assert/V that/P the/D whole/G following/N had/V been/V an/D accident/N ./O
Syme/R was/V galvanised/V with/P an/D energy/N that/O was/V something/N between/P bitterness/N and/C a/D burst/N of/P boyish/G derision/N ./O
He/Q made/V a/D wild/G gesture/N as/P if/P to/P knock/V the/D old/G man/N 's/O hat/N off/N ,/O called/V out/O something/N like/P ``/O Catch/R me/Q if/P you/Q can/O ,/O ''/O and/C went/V racing/V away/A across/P the/D white/G ,/O open/G Circus/R ./O

But/C the/D head/N upon/P that/D bounding/N body/N was/V still/A pale/G ,/O grave/G and/C professional/G ,/O like/P the/D head/N of/P a/D lecturer/N upon/P the/D body/N of/P a/D harlequin/N ./O

The/D member/N of/P the/D Legion/R of/P Honour/R ,/O whose/Q name/N it/Q seemed/V was/V Colonel/R Ducroix/R ,/O approached/V the/D Professor/R and/C Dr./R Bull/R with/P great/G politeness/N ,/O and/C suggested/V that/P the/D play/N should/O terminate/V with/P the/D first/G considerable/G hurt/N ./O

He/Q felt/V like/P a/D man/N who/Q had/V dreamed/V all/D night/N of/P falling/V over/P precipices/N ,/O and/C had/V woke/V up/O on/P the/D morning/N when/O he/Q was/V to/P be/V hanged/V ./O

At/P the/D risk/N of/P losing/V all/D ,/O the/D Marquis/R ,/O interrupting/V his/Q quiet/G stare/N ,/O flashed/V one/O glance/N over/P his/Q shoulder/N at/P the/D line/N of/P railway/N on/P his/Q right/N ./O
Then/A he/Q turned/V on/O Syme/P a/D face/N transfigured/V to/P that/D of/P a/D fiend/N ,/O and/C began/V to/P fight/V as/P if/P with/P twenty/O weapons/N ./O
The/D attack/N came/V so/A fast/A and/C furious/G ,/O that/P the/D one/O shining/V sword/N seemed/V a/D shower/N of/P shining/V arrows/N ./O
Syme/R had/V no/D chance/N to/P look/V at/P the/D railway/N ;/O but/C also/A he/Q had/V no/D need/N ./O
He/Q could/O guess/V the/D reason/N of/P the/D Marquis/R 's/O sudden/G madness/N of/P battle/N --/O the/D Paris/R train/N was/V in/P sight/N ./O

Twice/A Syme/R ,/O parrying/N ,/O knocked/V his/Q opponent/N 's/O point/N far/A out/P of/P the/D fighting/V circle/N ;/O and/C the/D third/G time/N his/Q riposte/N was/V so/A rapid/G ,/O that/P there/O was/V no/D doubt/N about/P the/D hit/N this/D time/N ./O
Syme/R 's/O sword/N actually/A bent/G under/P the/D weight/N of/P the/D Marquis/R 's/O body/N ,/O which/O it/Q had/V pierced/V ./O
Syme/R was/V as/P certain/G that/P he/Q had/V stuck/V his/Q blade/N into/P his/Q enemy/N as/P a/D gardener/N that/P he/Q has/V stuck/V his/Q spade/N into/P the/D ground/N ./O
Yet/C the/D Marquis/R sprang/V back/A from/P the/D stroke/N without/P a/D stagger/N ,/O and/C Syme/R stood/V staring/V at/P his/Q own/G sword-point/N like/P an/D idiot/N ./O
There/O was/V no/D blood/N on/P it/Q at/P all/D ./O
There/O was/V an/D instant/N of/P rigid/G silence/N ,/O and/C then/A Syme/R in/P his/Q turn/N fell/V furiously/A on/P the/D other/G ,/O filled/V with/P a/D flaming/G curiosity/N ./O
The/D Marquis/R was/V probably/A ,/O in/P a/D general/G sense/N ,/O a/D better/G fencer/N than/P he/Q ,/O as/P he/Q had/V surmised/V at/P the/D beginning/N ,/O but/C at/P the/D moment/N the/D Marquis/R seemed/V distraught/G and/C at/P a/D disadvantage/N ./O
He/Q fought/V wildly/A and/C even/A weakly/G ,/O and/C he/Q constantly/A looked/V away/O at/P the/D railway/N line/N ,/O almost/A as/P if/P he/Q feared/V the/D train/N more/G than/P the/D pointed/G steel/N ./O
Syme/R ,/O on/P the/D other/G hand/N ,/O fought/V fiercely/A but/C still/A carefully/A ,/O in/P an/D intellectual/G fury/N ,/O eager/G to/P solve/V the/D riddle/N of/P his/Q own/G bloodless/G sword/N ./O
For/P this/D purpose/N ,/O he/Q aimed/V less/G at/P the/D Marquis/R 's/O body/N ,/O and/C more/G at/P his/Q throat/N and/C head/N ./O
A/D minute/N and/C a/D half/N afterwards/A he/Q felt/V his/Q point/N enter/V the/D man/N 's/O neck/N below/P the/D jaw/N ./O
It/Q came/V out/A clean/G ./O
Half/D mad/G ,/O he/Q thrust/V again/A ,/O and/C made/V what/Q should/O have/V been/V a/D bloody/G scar/N on/P the/D Marquis/R 's/O cheek/N ./O
But/C there/O was/V no/D scar/N ./O
For/P one/O moment/N the/D heaven/N of/P Syme/N again/A grew/V black/G with/P supernatural/G terrors/N ./O
Surely/A the/D man/N had/V a/D charmed/V life/N ./O
But/C this/D new/G spiritual/G dread/N was/V a/D more/A awful/G thing/N than/P had/V been/V the/D mere/G spiritual/G topsy-turvydom/N symbolised/V by/P the/D paralytic/N who/Q pursued/V him/Q ./O
The/D Professor/R was/V only/A a/D goblin/N ;/O this/D man/N was/V a/D devil/N --/O perhaps/A he/Q was/V the/D Devil/R !/O

CHAPTER/N XV/P THE/D ACCUSER/R AS/R Syme/R strode/V along/P the/D corridor/N he/Q saw/V the/D Secretary/R standing/N at/P the/D top/N of/P a/D great/G flight/N of/P stairs/N ./O
The/D man/N had/V never/A looked/V so/A noble/G ./O
He/Q was/V draped/V in/P a/D long/G robe/N of/P starless/G black/G ,/O down/P the/D centre/N of/P which/O fell/V a/D band/N or/C broad/G stripe/N of/P pure/G white/G ,/O like/P a/D single/G shaft/N of/P light/N ./O
The/D whole/N looked/V like/P some/D very/A severe/G ecclesiastical/G vestment/N ./O
There/O was/V no/D need/N for/P Syme/R to/P search/V his/Q memory/N or/C the/D Bible/R in/P order/N to/P remember/V that/P the/D first/G day/N of/P creation/N marked/V the/D mere/G creation/N of/P light/G out/P of/P darkness/N ./O
The/D vestment/N itself/Q would/O alone/A have/V suggested/V the/D symbol/N ;/O and/C Syme/R felt/V also/A how/O perfectly/A this/D pattern/N of/P pure/G white/G and/C black/G expressed/V the/D soul/N of/P the/D pale/G and/C austere/G Secretary/R ,/O with/P his/Q inhuman/G veracity/N and/C his/Q cold/G frenzy/N ,/O which/O made/V him/Q so/A easily/A make/V war/N on/P the/D anarchists/N ,/O and/C yet/A so/A easily/A pass/V for/P one/O of/P them/Q ./O
Syme/R was/V scarcely/A surprised/V to/P notice/V that/D ,/O amid/P all/D the/D ease/N and/C hospitality/N of/P their/Q new/G surroundings/N ,/O this/D man/N 's/O eyes/N were/V still/A stern/G ./O
No/D smell/N of/P ale/N or/C orchards/N could/O make/V the/D Secretary/R cease/V to/P ask/V a/D reasonable/G question/N ./O
If/P Syme/R had/V been/V able/G to/P see/V himself/Q ,/O he/Q would/O have/V realised/V that/P he/Q ,/O too/A ,/O seemed/V to/P be/V for/P the/D first/G time/N himself/Q and/C no/D one/N else/A ./O
For/P if/P the/D Secretary/R stood/V for/P that/D philosopher/N who/Q loves/V the/D original/G and/C formless/G light/N ,/O Syme/R was/V a/D type/N of/P the/D poet/N who/Q seeks/V always/A to/P make/V the/D light/N in/P special/G shapes/N ,/O to/P split/V it/Q up/A into/P sun/N and/C star/N ./O
The/D philosopher/N may/O sometimes/A love/V the/D infinite/G ;/O the/D poet/N always/A loves/V the/D finite/N ./O
For/P him/Q the/D great/G moment/N is/V not/A the/D creation/N of/P light/N ,/O but/C the/D creation/N of/P the/D sun/N and/C moon/N ./O
As/P they/Q descended/V the/D broad/G stairs/N together/A they/Q overtook/V Ratcliffe/R ,/O who/Q was/V clad/V in/P spring/N green/N like/P a/D huntsman/N ,/O and/C the/D pattern/N upon/P whose/Q garment/N was/V a/D green/G tangle/N of/P trees/N ./O
For/P he/Q stood/V for/P that/D third/G day/N on/P which/O the/D earth/N and/C green/G things/N were/V made/V ,/O and/C his/Q square/N ,/O sensible/G face/N ,/O with/P its/Q not/A unfriendly/G cynicism/N ,/O seemed/V appropriate/G enough/A to/P it/Q ./O
They/Q were/V led/V out/P of/P another/D broad/G and/C low/G gateway/N into/P a/D very/A large/G old/G English/G garden/N ,/O full/G of/P torches/N and/C bonfires/N ,/O by/P the/D broken/G light/N of/P which/O a/D vast/G carnival/N of/P people/N were/V dancing/V in/P motley/N dress/N ./O
Syme/R seemed/V to/P see/V every/D shape/N in/P Nature/R imitated/V in/P some/D crazy/G costume/N ./O
There/O was/V a/D man/N dressed/V as/P a/D windmill/N with/P enormous/G sails/N ,/O a/D man/N dressed/V as/P an/D elephant/N ,/O a/D man/N dressed/V as/P a/D balloon/N ;/O the/D two/O last/G ,/O together/A ,/O seemed/V to/P keep/V the/D thread/N of/P their/Q farcical/G adventures/N ./O
Syme/R even/A saw/V ,/O with/P a/D queer/G thrill/N ,/O one/O dancer/N dressed/V like/P an/D enormous/G hornbill/N ,/O with/P a/D beak/N twice/A as/A big/G as/P himself/Q --/O the/D queer/G bird/N which/O had/V fixed/V itself/Q on/P his/Q fancy/N like/P a/D living/V question/N while/P he/Q was/V rushing/V down/P the/D long/G road/N at/P the/D Zoological/R Gardens/R ./O
There/O were/V a/D thousand/O other/G such/G objects/N ,/O however/A ./O
There/O was/V a/D dancing/N lamp-post/N ,/O a/D dancing/N apple/N tree/N ,/O a/D dancing/N ship/N ./O
One/O would/O have/V thought/V that/P the/D untamable/G tune/N of/P some/D mad/G musician/N had/V set/V all/D the/D common/G objects/N of/P field/N and/C street/N dancing/V an/D eternal/G jig/N ./O
And/C long/A afterwards/A ,/O when/O Syme/R was/V middle-aged/G and/C at/P rest/N ,/O he/Q could/O never/A see/V one/O of/P those/D particular/G objects/N --/O a/D lamppost/N ,/O or/C an/D apple/N tree/N ,/O or/C a/D windmill/N --/O without/P thinking/V that/P it/Q was/V a/D strayed/G reveller/N from/P that/D revel/N of/P masquerade/N ./O
On/P one/O side/N of/P this/D lawn/N ,/O alive/G with/P dancers/N ,/O was/V a/D sort/N of/P green/G bank/N ,/O like/P the/D terrace/N in/P such/G old-fashioned/G gardens/N ./O

The/D Professor/R ,/O whose/Q day/N was/V that/P on/P which/O the/D birds/N and/C fishes/N --/O the/D ruder/G forms/N of/P life/N --/O were/V created/V ,/O had/V a/D dress/N of/P dim/G purple/N ,/O over/P which/O sprawled/V goggle-eyed/G fishes/N and/C outrageous/G tropical/G birds/N ,/O the/D union/N in/P him/Q of/P unfathomable/G fancy/G and/C of/P doubt/N ./O
Dr./R Bull/R ,/O the/D last/G day/N of/P Creation/R ,/O wore/V a/D coat/N covered/V with/P heraldic/G animals/N in/P red/G and/C gold/N ,/O and/C on/P his/Q crest/N a/D man/N rampant/G ./O
He/Q lay/V back/O in/P his/Q chair/N with/P a/D broad/G smile/N ,/O the/D picture/N of/P an/D optimist/N in/P his/Q element/N ./O
One/O by/P one/O the/D wanderers/N ascended/V the/D bank/N and/C sat/V in/P their/Q strange/G seats/N ./O
As/P each/D of/P them/Q sat/V down/P a/D roar/N of/P enthusiasm/N rose/V from/P the/D carnival/N ,/O such/G as/P that/D with/P which/O crowds/N receive/V kings/N ./O
Cups/N were/V clashed/V and/C torches/V shaken/V ,/O and/C feathered/V hats/N flung/V in/P the/D air/N ./O
The/D men/N for/P whom/Q these/D thrones/N were/V reserved/V were/V men/N crowned/V with/P some/D extraordinary/G laurels/N ./O

Syme/R was/V on/P the/D left/G hand/N of/P it/Q and/C the/D Secretary/R on/P the/D right/N ./O
The/D Secretary/R looked/V across/P the/D empty/G throne/N at/P Syme/R ,/O and/C said/V ,/O compressing/V his/Q lips/N --/O ``/O We/Q do/V not/A know/V yet/A that/P he/Q is/V not/A dead/G in/P a/D field/N ./O ''/O
Almost/A as/P Syme/R heard/V the/D words/N ,/O he/Q saw/V on/P the/D sea/N of/P human/G faces/N in/P front/N of/P him/Q a/D frightful/G and/C beautiful/G alteration/N ,/O as/P if/P heaven/N had/V opened/V behind/P his/Q head/N ./O
