[/N The/D Wisdom/N of/P Father/R Brown/R by/P G./R K./R Chesterton/R 1914/O ]/N
I./R The/D Absence/N of/P Mr/R Glass/R
THE/D consulting-rooms/N of/P Dr/R Orion/R Hood/R ,/O the/D eminent/G criminologist/N and/C specialist/N in/P certain/G moral/G disorders/N ,/O lay/V along/P the/D sea-front/N at/P Scarborough/R ,/O in/P a/D series/N of/P very/A large/G and/C well-lighted/G french/G windows/N ,/O which/O showed/V the/D North/R Sea/R like/P one/O endless/G outer/G wall/N of/P blue-green/G marble/N ./O
In/P such/D a/D place/N the/D sea/N had/V something/N of/P the/D monotony/N of/P a/D blue-green/G dado/N :/O for/P the/D chambers/N themselves/Q were/V ruled/V throughout/P by/P a/D terrible/G tidiness/N not/A unlike/P the/D terrible/G tidiness/N of/P the/D sea/N ./O
It/Q must/O not/A be/V supposed/V that/P Dr/R Hood/R 's/O apartments/N excluded/V luxury/N ,/O or/C even/A poetry/N ./O
These/D things/N were/V there/A ,/O in/P their/Q place/N ;/O but/C one/O felt/V that/P they/Q were/V never/A allowed/V out/P of/P their/Q place/N ./O
Luxury/N was/V there/A :/O there/O stood/V upon/P a/D special/G table/N eight/O or/C ten/O boxes/N of/P the/D best/G cigars/N ;/O but/C they/Q were/V built/V upon/P a/D plan/N so/A that/P the/D strongest/G were/V always/A nearest/P the/D wall/N and/C the/D mildest/N nearest/P the/D window/N ./O
A/D tantalus/N containing/V three/O kinds/N of/P spirit/N ,/O all/D of/P a/D liqueur/N excellence/N ,/O stood/V always/A on/P this/D table/N of/P luxury/N ;/O but/C the/D fanciful/G have/V asserted/V that/P the/D whisky/N ,/O brandy/N ,/O and/C rum/N seemed/V always/A to/P stand/V at/P the/D same/G level/N ./O
Poetry/N was/V there/A :/O the/D left-hand/G corner/N of/P the/D room/N was/V lined/V with/P as/A complete/G a/D set/N of/P English/R classics/N as/P the/D right/G hand/N could/O show/V of/P English/R and/C foreign/G physiologists/N ./O
But/C if/P one/O took/V a/D volume/N of/P Chaucer/R or/C Shelley/R from/P that/D rank/N ,/O its/Q absence/N irritated/V the/D mind/N like/P a/D gap/N in/P a/D man/N 's/O front/G teeth/N ./O
One/O could/O not/A say/V the/D books/N were/V never/A read/V ;/O probably/A they/Q were/V ,/O but/C there/O was/V a/D sense/N of/P their/Q being/V chained/V to/P their/Q places/N ,/O like/P the/D Bibles/N in/P the/D old/G churches/N ./O
Dr/R Hood/R treated/V his/Q private/G book-shelf/N as/P if/P it/Q were/V a/D public/G library/N ./O
And/C if/P this/D strict/G scientific/G intangibility/N steeped/V even/A the/D shelves/N laden/G with/P lyrics/N and/C ballads/N and/C the/D tables/N laden/G with/P drink/N and/C tobacco/N ,/O it/Q goes/V without/P saying/V that/P yet/A more/G of/P such/G heathen/G holiness/N protected/V the/D other/G shelves/N that/O held/V the/D specialist/N 's/O library/N ,/O and/C the/D other/G tables/N that/O sustained/V the/D frail/G and/C even/A fairylike/G instruments/N of/P chemistry/N or/C mechanics/N ./O
Dr/R Hood/R paced/V the/D length/N of/P his/Q string/N of/P apartments/N ,/O bounded/V --/O as/P the/D boys/N '/O geographies/N say/V --/O on/P the/D east/G by/P the/D North/R Sea/R and/C on/P the/D west/N by/P the/D serried/G ranks/N of/P his/Q sociological/G and/C criminologist/G library/N ./O
He/Q was/V clad/V in/P an/D artist/N 's/O velvet/N ,/O but/C with/P none/N of/P an/D artist/N 's/O negligence/N ;/O his/Q hair/N was/V heavily/A shot/V with/P grey/N ,/O but/C growing/V thick/G and/C healthy/G ;/O his/Q face/N was/V lean/G ,/O but/C sanguine/G and/C expectant/G ./O
Everything/N about/P him/Q and/C his/Q room/N indicated/V something/N at/P once/A rigid/G and/C restless/G ,/O like/P that/D great/G northern/G sea/N by/P which/O (/O on/P pure/G principles/N of/P hygiene/N )/O he/Q had/V built/V his/Q home/N ./O
Fate/R ,/O being/V in/P a/D funny/G mood/N ,/O pushed/V the/D door/N open/G and/C introduced/V into/P those/D long/G ,/O strict/G ,/O sea-flanked/G apartments/N one/N who/Q was/V perhaps/A the/D most/A startling/G opposite/N of/P them/Q and/C their/Q master/N ./O
In/P answer/N to/P a/D curt/N but/C civil/G summons/N ,/O the/D door/N opened/V inwards/N and/C there/O shambled/V into/P the/D room/N a/D shapeless/G little/G figure/N ,/O which/O seemed/V to/P find/V its/Q own/G hat/N and/C umbrella/N as/P unmanageable/G as/P a/D mass/N of/P luggage/N ./O
The/D umbrella/N was/V a/D black/G and/C prosaic/G bundle/N long/G past/N repair/N ;/O the/D hat/N was/V a/D broad-curved/G black/G hat/N ,/O clerical/G but/C not/A common/G in/P England/R ;/O the/D man/N was/V the/D very/G embodiment/N of/P all/D that/D is/V homely/G and/C helpless/G ./O
The/D doctor/N regarded/V the/D new-comer/N with/P a/D restrained/V astonishment/N ,/O not/A unlike/P that/D he/Q would/O have/V shown/V if/P some/D huge/G but/C obviously/A harmless/G sea-beast/N had/V crawled/V into/P his/Q room/N ./O
The/D new-comer/N regarded/V the/D doctor/N with/P that/D beaming/G but/C breathless/G geniality/N which/O characterizes/V a/D corpulent/G charwoman/N who/Q has/V just/A managed/V to/P stuff/N herself/Q into/P an/D omnibus/N ./O
It/Q is/V a/D rich/G confusion/N of/P social/G self-congratulation/N and/C bodily/A disarray/N ./O
His/Q hat/N tumbled/V to/P the/D carpet/N ,/O his/Q heavy/G umbrella/N slipped/V between/P his/Q knees/N with/P a/D thud/N ;/O he/Q reached/V after/P the/D one/O and/C ducked/V after/P the/D other/G ,/O but/C with/P an/D unimpaired/G smile/N on/P his/Q round/G face/N spoke/V simultaneously/A as/P follows/V :/O ``/O My/Q name/N is/V Brown/R ./O

By/P this/D time/N he/Q had/V sprawlingly/A recovered/V the/D hat/N ,/O and/C made/V an/D odd/G little/G bobbing/G bow/N over/P it/Q ,/O as/P if/P setting/V everything/N quite/A right/G ./O

The/D brows/N of/P Dr/R Hood/R were/V drawn/V down/P darkly/A ,/O but/C the/D eyes/N under/P them/Q were/V bright/G with/P something/N that/O might/O be/V anger/N or/C might/O be/V amusement/N ./O

The/D little/G clergyman/N called/V Brown/R thanked/V him/Q with/P unquestionable/G warmth/N ,/O but/C still/A with/P a/D queer/G kind/N of/P simplicity/N ./O
It/Q was/V rather/A as/P if/P he/Q were/V thanking/V a/D stranger/N in/P a/D smoking-room/N for/P some/D trouble/N in/P passing/V the/D matches/N ,/O than/P as/P if/P he/Q were/V (/O as/P he/Q was/V )/O practically/A thanking/V the/D Curator/R of/P Kew/R Gardens/R for/P coming/V with/P him/Q into/P a/D field/N to/P find/V a/D four-leaved/G clover/N ./O

Of/P course/N I/Q do/V n't/A believe/V in/P the/D old/G legend/N about/P James/R I/R ;/O and/C as/A for/P you/Q ,/O you/Q do/V n't/A believe/V in/P anything/N ,/O not/A even/A in/P journalism/N ./O
The/D legend/N ,/O you/Q 'll/O probably/A remember/V ,/O was/V about/P the/D blackest/G business/N in/P English/R history/N --/O the/D poisoning/N of/P Overbury/R by/P that/D witch/N 's/O cat/N Frances/N Howard/R ,/O and/C the/D quite/A mysterious/G terror/N which/O forced/V the/D King/R to/P pardon/V the/D murderers/N ./O
There/O was/V a/D lot/N of/P alleged/V witchcraft/N mixed/V up/O with/P it/Q ;/O and/C the/D story/N goes/V that/P a/D man-servant/G listening/N at/P the/D keyhole/N heard/V the/D truth/N in/P a/D talk/N between/P the/D King/R and/C Carr/R ;/O and/C the/D bodily/N ear/N with/P which/O he/Q heard/V grew/V large/G and/C monstrous/G as/P by/P magic/G ,/O so/A awful/G was/V the/D secret/N ./O

But/C that/D is/V not/A the/D point/N The/D point/N is/V that/P there/O really/A is/V something/N queer/G about/P Exmoor/R and/C his/Q family/N ;/O something/N quite/A natural/G ,/O I/Q dare/V say/V ,/O but/C quite/A abnormal/G ./O

The/D reason/N I/Q point/V it/Q out/O to/P you/Q is/V this/D :/O It/Q seems/V to/P me/Q that/P we/Q make/V a/D mistake/N in/P attacking/V aristocracy/N entirely/A for/P its/Q champagne/N and/C diamonds/N ./O
Most/G men/N rather/A admire/V the/D nobs/N for/P having/V a/D good/G time/N ,/O but/C I/Q think/V we/Q surrender/V too/A much/A when/O we/Q admit/V that/P aristocracy/N has/V made/V even/A the/D aristocrats/R happy/G ./O

As/P for/P the/D headlines/N ,/O the/D sensational/G proclamations/N --/O they/Q will/O come/V at/P the/D end/N ./O
I/Q was/V walking/V along/P a/D public/G path/N that/P threads/N through/P a/D private/G Devonshire/G orchard/N and/C seems/V to/P point/V towards/P Devonshire/R cider/N ,/O when/O I/Q came/V suddenly/A upon/P just/A such/D a/D place/N as/P the/D path/N suggested/V ./O
It/Q was/V a/D long/G ,/O low/G inn/N ,/O consisting/V really/A of/P a/D cottage/N and/C two/O barns/N ;/O thatched/V all/D over/A with/P the/D thatch/R that/O looks/V like/P brown/G and/C grey/G hair/N grown/V before/P history/N ./O
But/C outside/P the/D door/N was/V a/D sign/N which/O called/V it/Q the/D Blue/R Dragon/R ;/O and/C under/P the/D sign/N was/V one/O of/P those/D long/G rustic/G tables/N that/O used/V to/P stand/V outside/P most/G of/P the/D free/G English/G inns/N ,/O before/P teetotallers/N and/C brewers/N between/P them/Q destroyed/V freedom/N ./O
And/C at/P this/D table/N sat/V three/O gentlemen/N ,/O who/Q might/O have/V lived/V a/D hundred/O years/N ago/A ./O
Now/A that/P I/Q know/V them/Q all/D better/G ,/O there/O is/V no/D difficulty/N about/P disentangling/V the/D impressions/N ;/O but/C just/A then/A they/Q looked/V like/P three/O very/A solid/G ghosts/N ./O
The/D dominant/G figure/N ,/O both/D because/P he/Q was/V bigger/G in/P all/D three/O dimensions/N ,/O and/C because/P he/Q sat/V centrally/A in/P the/D length/N of/P the/D table/N ,/O facing/V me/Q ,/O was/V a/D tall/G ,/O fat/G man/N dressed/V completely/A in/P black/G ,/O with/P a/D rubicund/N ,/O even/A apoplectic/G visage/N ,/O but/C a/D rather/A bald/G and/C rather/A bothered/V brow/N ./O
Looking/V at/P him/Q again/A ,/O more/G strictly/A ,/O I/Q could/O not/A exactly/A say/V what/Q it/Q was/V that/P gave/V me/Q the/D sense/N of/P antiquity/N ,/O except/P the/D antique/G cut/N of/P his/Q white/G clerical/G necktie/N and/C the/D barred/V wrinkles/N across/P his/Q brow/N ./O
It/Q was/V even/A less/G easy/G to/P fix/V the/D impression/N in/P the/D case/N of/P the/D man/N at/P the/D right/G end/N of/P the/D table/N ,/O who/Q ,/O to/P say/V truth/N ,/O was/V as/P commonplace/N a/D person/N as/A could/O be/V seen/V anywhere/A ,/O with/P a/D round/N ,/O brown-haired/G head/N and/C a/D round/N snub/N nose/N ,/O but/C also/A clad/V in/P clerical/G black/G ,/O of/P a/D stricter/N cut/N ./O
It/Q was/V only/A when/O I/Q saw/V his/Q broad/G curved/G hat/N lying/V on/P the/D table/N beside/P him/Q that/P I/Q realized/V why/O I/Q connected/V him/Q with/P anything/N ancient/G ./O
He/Q was/V a/D Roman/G Catholic/G priest/N ./O
Perhaps/A the/D third/G man/N ,/O at/P the/D other/G end/N of/P the/D table/N ,/O had/V really/A more/G to/P do/V with/P it/Q than/P the/D rest/N ,/O though/P he/Q was/V both/D slighter/N in/P physical/G presence/N and/C more/G inconsiderate/N in/P his/Q dress/N ./O
His/Q lank/N limbs/N were/V clad/V ,/O I/Q might/O also/A say/V clutched/V ,/O in/P very/A tight/G grey/N sleeves/N and/C pantaloons/N ;/O he/Q had/V a/D long/G ,/O sallow/G ,/O aquiline/G face/N which/O seemed/V somehow/A all/D the/D more/G saturnine/N because/P his/Q lantern/N jaws/N were/V imprisoned/V in/P his/Q collar/N and/C neck-cloth/G more/G in/P the/D style/N of/P the/D old/G stock/N ;/O and/C his/Q hair/N (/O which/O ought/O to/P have/V been/V dark/G brown/N )/O was/V of/P an/D odd/G dim/G ,/O russet/N colour/N which/O ,/O in/P conjunction/N with/P his/Q yellow/G face/N ,/O looked/V rather/A purple/G than/P red/G ./O
The/D unobtrusive/G yet/A unusual/G colour/N was/V all/D the/D more/A notable/G because/P his/Q hair/N was/V almost/A unnaturally/A healthy/G and/C curling/G ,/O and/C he/Q wore/V it/Q full/G ./O
But/C ,/O after/P all/D analysis/N ,/O I/Q incline/V to/P think/V that/P what/Q gave/V me/Q my/Q first/G old-fashioned/G impression/N was/V simply/A a/D set/N of/P tall/G ,/O old-fashioned/G wine-glasses/N ,/O one/O or/C two/O lemons/N and/C two/O churchwarden/G pipes/N ./O
And/C also/A ,/O perhaps/A ,/O the/D old-world/N errand/N on/P which/O I/Q had/V come/V ./O
Being/V a/D hardened/G reporter/N ,/O and/C it/Q being/V apparently/A a/D public/G inn/N ,/O I/Q did/V not/A need/V to/P summon/V much/A of/P my/Q impudence/N to/P sit/V down/O at/P the/D long/G table/N and/C order/N some/D cider/N ./O
The/D big/G man/N in/P black/G seemed/V very/A learned/V ,/O especially/A about/P local/G antiquities/N ;/O the/D small/G man/N in/P black/G ,/O though/P he/Q talked/V much/A less/G ,/O surprised/V me/Q with/P a/D yet/A wider/G culture/N ./O
So/P we/Q got/V on/P very/A well/A together/A ;/O but/C the/D third/G man/N ,/O the/D old/G gentleman/N in/P the/D tight/G pantaloons/N ,/O seemed/V rather/A distant/G and/C haughty/G ,/O until/P I/Q slid/V into/P the/D subject/N of/P the/D Duke/R of/P Exmoor/R and/C his/Q ancestry/N ./O
I/Q thought/V the/D subject/N seemed/V to/P embarrass/V the/D other/G two/O a/D little/A ;/O but/C it/Q broke/V the/D spell/N of/P the/D third/G man/N 's/O silence/N most/A successfully/A ./O
Speaking/V with/P restraint/N and/C with/P the/D accent/N of/P a/D highly/A educated/V gentleman/N ,/O and/C puffing/N at/P intervals/N at/P his/Q long/G churchwarden/N pipe/N ,/O he/Q proceeded/V to/P tell/V me/Q some/D of/P the/D most/A horrible/G stories/N I/Q have/V ever/A heard/V in/P my/Q life/N :/O how/O one/O of/P the/D Eyres/N in/P the/D former/G ages/N had/V hanged/V his/Q own/G father/N ;/O and/C another/D had/V his/Q wife/N scourged/V at/P the/D cart/N tail/N through/P the/D village/N ;/O and/C another/D had/V set/V fire/N to/P a/D church/N full/G of/P children/N ,/O and/C so/A on/A ./O

He/Q heard/V Fanshaw/R say/V there/O was/V no/D need/N to/P be/V silly/G ;/O that/P not/A only/A had/V Cornish/G captains/N been/V heroes/N ,/O but/C that/P they/Q were/V heroes/N still/A :/O that/P near/P that/D very/A spot/V there/O was/V an/D old/G admiral/N ,/O now/A retired/V ,/O who/Q was/V scarred/V by/P thrilling/V voyages/N full/G of/P adventures/N ;/O and/C who/Q had/V in/P his/Q youth/N found/V the/D last/G group/N of/P eight/O Pacific/R Islands/R that/O was/V added/V to/P the/D chart/N of/P the/D world/N ./O

The/D big/G shoulders/N ,/O black/G brows/N and/C black/G mousquetaire/N swagger/N of/P Flambeau/R were/V a/D great/G contrast/N ./O

About/P this/D particular/G evening/N ,/O however/A ,/O there/O was/V something/N exceptional/G ./O
It/Q was/V one/O of/P those/D rare/G atmospheres/N in/P which/O a/D smoked-glass/N slide/N seems/V to/P have/V been/V slid/V away/A from/P between/P us/Q and/C Nature/R ;/O so/C that/P even/A dark/G colours/N on/P that/D day/N look/V more/G gorgeous/G than/P bright/G colours/N on/P cloudier/N days/N ./O
The/D trampled/G earth/N of/P the/D river-banks/N and/C the/D peaty/G stain/N in/P the/D pools/N did/V not/A look/V drab/G but/C glowing/G umber/N ,/O and/C the/D dark/G woods/N astir/N in/P the/D breeze/N did/V not/A look/V ,/O as/P usual/G ,/O dim/G blue/G with/P mere/G depth/N of/P distance/N ,/O but/C more/G like/P wind-tumbled/G masses/N of/P some/D vivid/G violet/N blossom/N ./O
This/D magic/G clearness/N and/C intensity/N in/P the/D colours/N was/V further/A forced/V on/P Brown/R 's/O slowly/A reviving/V senses/N by/P something/N romantic/G and/C even/A secret/G in/P the/D very/G form/N of/P the/D landscape/N ./O
The/D river/N was/V still/A well/A wide/G and/C deep/G enough/A for/P a/D pleasure/N boat/N so/A small/G as/P theirs/G ;/O but/C the/D curves/N of/P the/D country-side/N suggested/V that/P it/Q was/V closing/V in/P on/P either/D hand/N ;/O the/D woods/N seemed/V to/P be/V making/V broken/G and/C flying/V attempts/N at/P bridge-building/G --/O as/P if/P the/D boat/N were/V passing/V from/P the/D romance/N of/P a/D valley/N to/P the/D romance/N of/P a/D hollow/N and/C so/A to/P the/D supreme/N romance/N of/P a/D tunnel/N ./O
Beyond/P this/D mere/G look/N of/P things/N there/A was/V little/G for/P Brown/R 's/O freshening/N fancy/N to/P feed/V on/P ;/O he/Q saw/V no/D human/G beings/N ,/O except/P some/D gipsies/N trailing/V along/P the/D river/N bank/N ,/O with/P faggots/N and/C osiers/N cut/V in/P the/D forest/N ;/O and/C one/O sight/N no/A longer/A unconventional/G ,/O but/C in/P such/G remote/G parts/N still/A uncommon/G :/O a/D dark-haired/G lady/N ,/O bare-headed/G ,/O and/C paddling/V her/Q own/G canoe/N ./O
If/P Father/R Brown/R ever/A attached/V any/D importance/N to/P either/D of/P these/D ,/O he/Q certainly/A forgot/V them/Q at/P the/D next/G turn/N of/P the/D river/N which/O brought/V in/O sight/N a/D singular/G object/N ./O

With/P the/D rate/N at/P which/O they/Q went/V ,/O the/D islet/N seemed/V to/P swim/V towards/P them/Q like/P a/D ship/N ;/O a/D ship/N with/P a/D very/A high/G prow/N --/O or/C ,/O to/P speak/V more/A strictly/A ,/O a/D very/A high/G funnel/N ./O
