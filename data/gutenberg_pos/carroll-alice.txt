CHAPTER/R I./N Down/P the/D Rabbit-Hole/N
Alice/R was/V beginning/V to/P get/V very/A tired/G of/P sitting/V by/P her/Q sister/N on/P the/D bank/N ,/O and/C of/P having/V nothing/N to/P do/V :/O once/A or/C twice/A she/Q had/V peeped/V into/P the/D book/N her/Q sister/N was/V reading/V ,/O but/C it/Q had/V no/D pictures/N or/C conversations/N in/P it/Q ,/O `/O and/C what/Q is/V the/D use/N of/P a/D book/N ,/O '/O thought/V Alice/R `/O without/P pictures/N or/C conversation/N ?/O
'/O So/P she/Q was/V considering/V in/P her/Q own/G mind/N (/O as/A well/A as/P she/Q could/O ,/O for/P the/D hot/G day/N made/V her/Q feel/V very/A sleepy/G and/C stupid/G )/O ,/O whether/P the/D pleasure/N of/P making/V a/D daisy-chain/N would/O be/V worth/P the/D trouble/N of/P getting/V up/O and/C picking/V the/D daisies/N ,/O when/O suddenly/A a/D White/R Rabbit/R with/P pink/N eyes/N ran/V close/A by/P her/Q ./O
There/O was/V nothing/N so/A VERY/G remarkable/G in/P that/D ;/O nor/C did/V Alice/R think/V it/Q so/A VERY/A much/G out/P of/P the/D way/N to/P hear/V the/D Rabbit/N say/V to/P itself/Q ,/O `/O Oh/O dear/O !/O

'/O (/O when/O she/Q thought/V it/Q over/P afterwards/A ,/O it/Q occurred/V to/P her/Q that/O she/Q ought/O to/P have/V wondered/V at/P this/D ,/O but/C at/P the/D time/N it/Q all/D seemed/V quite/A natural/G )/O ;/O but/C when/O the/D Rabbit/N actually/A TOOK/P A/D WATCH/R OUT/R OF/P ITS/R WAISTCOAT-POCKET/R ,/O and/C looked/V at/P it/Q ,/O and/C then/A hurried/V on/P ,/O Alice/R started/V to/P her/Q feet/N ,/O for/P it/Q flashed/V across/P her/Q mind/N that/P she/Q had/V never/A before/A seen/V a/D rabbit/N with/P either/C a/D waistcoat-pocket/N ,/O or/C a/D watch/N to/P take/V out/O of/P it/Q ,/O and/C burning/V with/P curiosity/N ,/O she/Q ran/V across/P the/D field/N after/P it/Q ,/O and/C fortunately/A was/V just/A in/P time/N to/P see/V it/Q pop/V down/O a/D large/G rabbit-hole/N under/P the/D hedge/N ./O
In/P another/D moment/N down/A went/V Alice/R after/P it/Q ,/O never/A once/A considering/V how/O in/P the/D world/N she/Q was/V to/P get/V out/O again/A ./O
The/D rabbit-hole/N went/V straight/A on/P like/P a/D tunnel/N for/P some/D way/N ,/O and/C then/A dipped/V suddenly/A down/A ,/O so/A suddenly/A that/P Alice/R had/V not/A a/D moment/N to/P think/V about/P stopping/V herself/Q before/P she/Q found/V herself/Q falling/V down/O a/D very/A deep/A well/A ./O
Either/C the/D well/N was/V very/A deep/G ,/O or/C she/Q fell/V very/A slowly/A ,/O for/P she/Q had/V plenty/N of/P time/N as/P she/Q went/V down/A to/P look/V about/P her/Q and/C to/P wonder/V what/Q was/V going/V to/P happen/V next/G ./O
First/A ,/O she/Q tried/V to/P look/V down/O and/C make/V out/O what/Q she/Q was/V coming/V to/P ,/O but/C it/Q was/V too/A dark/G to/P see/V anything/N ;/O then/A she/Q looked/V at/P the/D sides/N of/P the/D well/N ,/O and/C noticed/V that/P they/Q were/V filled/V with/P cupboards/N and/C book-shelves/N ;/O here/A and/C there/O she/Q saw/V maps/N and/C pictures/N hung/V upon/P pegs/N ./O
She/Q took/V down/O a/D jar/N from/P one/O of/P the/D shelves/N as/P she/Q passed/V ;/O it/Q was/V labelled/V `/O ORANGE/R MARMALADE/R '/O ,/O but/C to/P her/Q great/G disappointment/N it/Q was/V empty/G :/O she/Q did/V not/A like/V to/P drop/V the/D jar/N for/P fear/N of/P killing/V somebody/N ,/O so/A managed/V to/P put/V it/Q into/P one/O of/P the/D cupboards/N as/P she/Q fell/V past/P it/Q ./O

There/O was/V not/A a/D moment/N to/P be/V lost/V :/O away/A went/V Alice/R like/P the/D wind/N ,/O and/C was/V just/A in/P time/N to/P hear/V it/Q say/V ,/O as/P it/Q turned/V a/D corner/N ,/O `/O Oh/O my/Q ears/N and/C whiskers/N ,/O how/O late/G it/Q 's/V getting/V !/O
