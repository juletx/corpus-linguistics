I./R A/R DISCUSSION/N SOMEWHAT/N IN/P THE/D AIR/N
The/D flying/V ship/N of/P Professor/R Lucifer/R sang/V through/P the/D skies/N like/P a/D silver/N arrow/N ;/O the/D bleak/G white/G steel/N of/P it/Q ,/O gleaming/V in/P the/D bleak/G blue/G emptiness/N of/P the/D evening/N ./O
That/D it/Q was/V far/A above/P the/D earth/N was/V no/D expression/N for/P it/Q ;/O to/P the/D two/O men/N in/P it/Q ,/O it/Q seemed/V to/P be/V far/A above/P the/D stars/N ./O
The/D professor/N had/V himself/Q invented/V the/D flying/V machine/N ,/O and/C had/V also/A invented/V nearly/A everything/N in/P it/Q ./O
Every/D sort/N of/P tool/N or/C apparatus/N had/V ,/O in/P consequence/N ,/O to/P the/D full/G ,/O that/P fantastic/G and/C distorted/G look/N which/O belongs/V to/P the/D miracles/N of/P science/N ./O
For/P the/D world/N of/P science/N and/C evolution/N is/V far/A more/A nameless/A and/C elusive/G and/C like/P a/D dream/N than/P the/D world/N of/P poetry/N and/C religion/N ;/O since/P in/P the/D latter/G images/N and/C ideas/N remain/V themselves/Q eternally/A ,/O while/P it/Q is/V the/D whole/G idea/N of/P evolution/N that/P identities/N melt/V into/P each/D other/G as/P they/Q do/V in/P a/D nightmare/N ./O
All/D the/D tools/N of/P Professor/R Lucifer/R were/V the/D ancient/G human/G tools/N gone/V mad/G ,/O grown/G into/P unrecognizable/G shapes/N ,/O forgetful/G of/P their/Q origin/N ,/O forgetful/G of/P their/Q names/N ./O
That/D thing/N which/O looked/V like/P an/D enormous/G key/N with/P three/O wheels/N was/V really/A a/D patent/N and/C very/A deadly/G revolver/N ./O
That/D object/N which/O seemed/V to/P be/V created/V by/P the/D entanglement/N of/P two/O corkscrews/N was/V really/A the/D key/N ./O
The/D thing/N which/O might/O have/V been/V mistaken/V for/P a/D tricycle/N turned/V upside-down/A was/V the/D inexpressibly/A important/G instrument/N to/P which/O the/D corkscrew/N was/V the/D key/N ./O
All/D these/D things/N ,/O as/P I/Q say/V ,/O the/D professor/N had/V invented/V ;/O he/Q had/V invented/V everything/N in/P the/D flying/V ship/N ,/O with/P the/D exception/N ,/O perhaps/A ,/O of/P himself/Q ./O
This/D he/Q had/V been/V born/V too/A late/G actually/A to/P inaugurate/V ,/O but/C he/Q believed/V at/P least/G ,/O that/P he/Q had/V considerably/A improved/V it/Q ./O
There/O was/V ,/O however/A ,/O another/D man/N on/P board/N ,/O so/A to/P speak/V ,/O at/P the/D time/N ./O
Him/Q ,/O also/A ,/O by/P a/D curious/G coincidence/N ,/O the/D professor/N had/V not/A invented/V ,/O and/C him/Q he/Q had/V not/A even/A very/A greatly/A improved/V ,/O though/P he/Q had/V fished/V him/Q up/O with/P a/D lasso/N out/P of/P his/Q own/G back/G garden/N ,/O in/P Western/R Bulgaria/R ,/O with/P the/D pure/G object/N of/P improving/V him/Q ./O
He/Q was/V an/D exceedingly/A holy/G man/N ,/O almost/A entirely/A covered/V with/P white/G hair/N ./O
You/Q could/O see/V nothing/N but/C his/Q eyes/N ,/O and/C he/Q seemed/V to/P talk/V with/P them/Q ./O
A/D monk/N of/P immense/G learning/N and/C acute/G intellect/N he/Q had/V made/V himself/Q happy/G in/P a/D little/G stone/N hut/N and/C a/D little/G stony/N garden/N in/P the/D Balkans/R ,/O chiefly/A by/P writing/V the/D most/A crushing/V refutations/N of/P exposures/N of/P certain/G heresies/N ,/O the/D last/G professors/N of/P which/O had/V been/V burnt/V (/O generally/A by/P each/D other/G )/O precisely/A 1,119/O years/N previously/A ./O
They/Q were/V really/A very/A plausible/G and/C thoughtful/G heresies/N ,/O and/C it/Q was/V really/A a/D creditable/G or/C even/A glorious/G circumstance/N ,/O that/P the/D old/G monk/N had/V been/V intellectual/G enough/A to/P detect/V their/Q fallacy/N ;/O the/D only/G misfortune/N was/V that/P nobody/N in/P the/D modern/G world/N was/V intellectual/G enough/A even/A to/P understand/V their/Q argument/N ./O
The/D old/G monk/N ,/O one/O of/P whose/Q names/N was/V Michael/R ,/O and/C the/D other/G a/D name/N quite/A impossible/G to/P remember/V or/C repeat/V in/P our/Q Western/G civilization/N ,/O had/V ,/O however/A ,/O as/P I/Q have/V said/V ,/O made/V himself/Q quite/A happy/G while/P he/Q was/V in/P a/D mountain/N hermitage/N in/P the/D society/N of/P wild/G animals/N ./O
And/C now/A that/P his/Q luck/N had/V lifted/V him/Q above/P all/D the/D mountains/N in/P the/D society/N of/P a/D wild/G physicist/N ,/O he/Q made/V himself/Q happy/G still/A ./O

The/D tongue/N of/P a/D terrible/G organ/N seemed/V to/P shake/V the/D very/G air/N in/P the/D whole/G void/N ;/O and/C through/P it/Q there/A came/V up/O to/P Michael/R the/D sound/N of/P a/D tongue/N more/A terrible/G ;/O the/D dreadful/G everlasting/G voice/N of/P man/N ,/O calling/V to/P his/Q gods/N from/P the/D beginning/N to/P the/D end/N of/P the/D world/N ./O
Michael/R felt/V almost/A as/P if/P he/Q were/V a/D god/N ,/O and/C all/D the/D voices/N were/V hurled/V at/P him/Q ./O

A/D DISCUSSION/N AT/O DAWN/R The/D duellists/N had/V from/P their/Q own/G point/N of/P view/N escaped/V or/C conquered/V the/D chief/G powers/N of/P the/D modern/G world/N ./O

Every/D morning/N and/C evening/N an/D iron/N hatchway/N opened/V in/P his/Q oblong/G cell/N ,/O and/C a/D brown/G hairy/G hand/N or/C two/O thrust/N in/P a/D plate/N of/P perfectly/A cooked/V lentils/N and/C a/D big/G bowl/N of/P cocoa/N ./O

He/Q had/V ample/G walking/N space/N ,/O ample/G air/N ,/O ample/G and/C even/A filling/V food/N ./O
The/D only/G objection/N was/V that/P he/Q had/V nothing/N to/P walk/V towards/P ,/O nothing/N to/P feast/V about/A ,/O and/C no/D reason/N whatever/O for/P drawing/V the/D breath/N of/P life/N ./O
Even/A the/D shape/N of/P his/Q cell/N especially/A irritated/G him/Q ./O
It/Q was/V a/D long/G ,/O narrow/G parallelogram/N ,/O which/O had/V a/D flat/G wall/N at/P one/O end/N and/C ought/O to/P have/V had/V a/D flat/G wall/N at/P the/D other/G ;/O but/C that/D end/N was/V broken/V by/P a/D wedge/N or/C angle/N of/P space/N ,/O like/P the/D prow/N of/P a/D ship/N ./O
After/P three/O days/N of/P silence/N and/C cocoa/N ,/O this/D angle/N at/P the/D end/N began/V to/P infuriate/V Turnbull/N ./O
It/Q maddened/V him/Q to/P think/V that/P two/O lines/N came/V together/A and/C pointed/V at/P nothing/N ./O
After/P the/D fifth/G day/N he/Q was/V reckless/G ,/O and/C poked/V his/Q head/N into/P the/D corner/N ./O
After/P twenty-five/O days/N he/Q almost/A broke/V his/Q head/N against/P it/Q ./O
Then/A he/Q became/V quite/A cool/G and/C stupid/G again/A ,/O and/C began/V to/P examine/V it/Q like/P a/D sort/N of/P Robinson/R Crusoe/R ./O
Almost/A unconsciously/A it/Q was/V his/Q instinct/N to/P examine/V outlets/N ,/O and/C he/Q found/V himself/Q paying/V particular/G attention/N to/P the/D row/N of/P holes/N which/O let/V in/P the/D air/N into/P his/Q last/G house/N of/P life/N ./O

One/O evening/N while/P he/Q was/V engaged/V in/P the/D fifth/G investigation/N he/Q noticed/V something/N like/P twilight/N in/P one/O of/P these/D dumb/G mouths/N ,/O as/P compared/V with/P the/D darkness/N of/P the/D others/N ./O
Thrusting/V his/Q finger/N in/P as/A far/A as/P it/Q would/O go/V ,/O he/Q found/V a/D hole/N and/C flapping/V edge/N in/P the/D tube/N ./O

It/Q is/V a/D characteristic/N of/P all/D things/N now/A called/V ``/O efficient/G ''/O ,/O which/O means/V mechanical/G and/C calculated/G ,/O that/P if/P they/Q go/V wrong/G at/P all/D they/Q go/V entirely/A wrong/G ./O
There/O is/V no/D power/N of/P retrieving/V a/D defeat/N ,/O as/P in/P simpler/G and/C more/G living/N organisms/N ./O
A/D strong/G gun/N can/O conquer/V a/D strong/G elephant/N ,/O but/C a/D wounded/V elephant/N can/O easily/A conquer/V a/D broken/G gun/N ./O
Thus/A the/D Prussian/G monarchy/N in/P the/D eighteenth/G century/N ,/O or/C now/A ,/O can/O make/V a/D strong/G army/N merely/A by/P making/V the/D men/N afraid/G ./O

Thus/A the/D drainage/N in/P our/Q cities/N so/A long/A as/P it/Q is/V quite/A solid/G means/N a/D general/G safety/N ,/O but/C if/P there/O is/V one/O leak/G it/Q means/V concentrated/G poison/N --/O an/D explosion/N of/P deathly/G germs/N like/P dynamite/N ,/O a/D spirit/N of/P stink/N ./O
Thus/A ,/O indeed/A ,/O all/D that/D excellent/G machinery/N which/O is/V the/D swiftest/G thing/N on/P earth/N in/P saving/V human/G labour/N is/V also/A the/D slowest/G thing/N on/P earth/N in/P resisting/N human/G interference/N ./O
It/Q may/O be/V easier/G to/P get/V chocolate/N for/P nothing/N out/P of/P a/D shopkeeper/N than/P out/P of/P an/D automatic/G machine/N ./O

Turnbull/N was/V not/A long/A in/P discovering/V this/D truth/N in/P connexion/N with/P the/D cold/G and/C colossal/G machinery/N of/P this/D great/G asylum/N ./O
He/Q had/V been/V shaken/V by/P many/G spiritual/G states/N since/P the/D instant/N when/O he/Q was/V pitched/V head/N foremost/A into/P that/D private/G cell/N which/O was/V to/P be/V his/Q private/G room/N till/P death/N ./O
He/Q had/V felt/V a/D high/G fit/N of/P pride/N and/C poetry/N ,/O which/O had/V ebbed/V away/A and/C left/V him/Q deadly/G cold/N ./O
He/Q had/V known/V a/D period/N of/P mere/G scientific/G curiosity/N ,/O in/P the/D course/N of/P which/O he/Q examined/V all/D the/D tiles/N of/P his/Q cell/N ,/O with/P the/D gratifying/G conclusion/N that/P they/Q were/V all/D the/D same/G shape/N and/C size/N ;/O but/C was/V greatly/A puzzled/V about/P the/D angle/N in/P the/D wall/N at/P the/D end/N ,/O and/C also/A about/P an/D iron/N peg/N or/C spike/N that/O stood/V out/O from/P the/D wall/N ,/O the/D object/N of/P which/O he/Q does/V not/A know/V to/P this/D day/N ./O
Then/A he/Q had/V a/D period/N of/P mere/G madness/N not/A to/P be/V written/V of/O by/P decent/G men/N ,/O but/C only/A by/P those/D few/G dirty/G novelists/N hallooed/V on/P by/P the/D infernal/G huntsman/N to/P hunt/N down/O and/C humiliate/G human/G nature/N ./O
This/D also/A passed/V ,/O but/C left/V behind/O it/Q a/D feverish/G distaste/N for/P many/G of/P the/D mere/G objects/N around/P him/Q ./O
Long/A after/P he/Q had/V returned/V to/P sanity/N and/C such/G hopeless/G cheerfulness/N as/P a/D man/N might/O have/V on/P a/D desert/N island/N ,/O he/Q disliked/V the/D regular/G squares/N of/P the/D pattern/N of/P wall/N and/C floor/N and/C the/D triangle/N that/O terminated/V his/Q corridor/N ./O
Above/P all/D ,/O he/Q had/V a/D hatred/N ,/O deep/G as/P the/D hell/N he/Q did/V not/A believe/V in/P ,/O for/P the/D objectless/G iron/N peg/N in/P the/D wall/N ./O
But/C in/P all/D his/Q moods/N ,/O sane/N or/C insane/G ,/O intolerant/G or/C stoical/G ,/O he/Q never/A really/A doubted/V this/D :/O that/P the/D machine/N held/V him/Q as/P light/N and/C as/A hopelessly/A as/P he/Q had/V from/P his/Q birth/N been/V held/V by/P the/D hopeless/G cosmos/N of/P his/Q own/G creed/N ./O
He/Q knew/V well/A the/D ruthless/G and/C inexhaustible/G resources/N of/P our/Q scientific/G civilization/N ./O
He/Q no/D more/A expected/G rescue/N from/P a/D medical/G certificate/N than/P rescue/N from/P the/D solar/G system/N ./O
In/P many/G of/P his/Q Robinson/R Crusoe/R moods/N he/Q thought/V kindly/A of/P MacIan/R as/P of/P some/D quarrelsome/G school-fellow/N who/Q had/V long/G been/V dead/G ./O
He/Q thought/V of/P leaving/V in/P the/D cell/N when/O he/Q died/V a/D rigid/G record/N of/P his/Q opinions/N ,/O and/C when/O he/Q began/V to/P write/V them/Q down/O on/P scraps/N of/P envelope/N in/P his/Q pocket/N ,/O he/Q was/V startled/V to/P discover/V how/O much/G they/Q had/V changed/V ./O
Then/A he/Q remembered/V the/D Beauchamp/R Tower/R ,/O and/C tried/V to/P write/V his/Q blazing/V scepticism/N on/P the/D wall/N ,/O and/C discovered/V that/P it/Q was/V all/D shiny/G tiles/N on/P which/O nothing/N could/O be/V either/A drawn/V or/C carved/V ./O
Then/A for/P an/D instant/N there/A hung/V and/C broke/V above/P him/Q like/P a/D high/G wave/N the/D whole/G horror/N of/P scientific/G imprisonment/N ,/O which/O manages/V to/P deny/V a/D man/N not/A only/A liberty/N ,/O but/C every/D accidental/G comfort/N of/P bondage/N ./O
In/P the/D old/G filthy/G dungeons/N men/N could/O carve/V their/Q prayers/N or/C protests/N in/P the/D rock/N ./O
Here/A the/D white/G and/C slippery/G walls/N escaped/V even/A from/P bearing/V witness/N ./O
The/D old/G prisoners/N could/O make/V a/D pet/N of/P a/D mouse/N or/C a/D beetle/N strayed/V out/P of/P a/D hole/N ./O
Here/A the/D unpierceable/G walls/N were/V washed/V every/D morning/N by/P an/D automatic/G sluice/N ./O
There/O was/V no/D natural/G corruption/N and/C no/D merciful/G decay/N by/P which/O a/D living/V thing/N could/O enter/V in/P ./O
Then/A James/R Turnbull/R looked/V up/O and/C saw/V the/D high/G invincible/G hatefulness/N of/P the/D society/N in/P which/O he/Q lived/V ,/O and/C saw/V the/D hatefulness/N of/P something/N else/A also/A ,/O which/O he/Q told/V himself/Q again/A and/C again/A was/V not/A the/D cosmos/N in/P which/O he/Q believed/V ./O
But/C all/D the/D time/N he/Q had/V never/A once/A doubted/V that/P the/D five/O sides/N of/P his/Q cell/N were/V for/P him/Q the/D wall/N of/P the/D world/N henceforward/A ,/O and/C it/Q gave/V him/Q a/D shock/N of/P surprise/N even/A to/P discover/V the/D faint/G light/N through/P the/D aperture/N in/P the/D ventilation/N tube/N ./O
But/C he/Q had/V forgotten/V how/O close/G efficiency/N has/V to/P pack/V everything/N together/A and/C how/O easily/A ,/O therefore/A ,/O a/D pipe/N here/A or/C there/A may/O leak/V ./O
Turnbull/N thrust/V his/Q first/G finger/N down/P the/D aperture/N ,/O and/C at/P last/G managed/V to/P make/V a/D slight/G further/G fissure/N in/P the/D piping/N ./O
The/D light/N that/O came/V up/O from/P beyond/P was/V very/A faint/G ,/O and/C apparently/A indirect/G ;/O it/Q seemed/V to/P fall/V from/P some/D hole/N or/C window/N higher/G up/A ./O
As/P he/Q was/V screwing/V his/Q eye/N to/P peer/V at/P this/D grey/N and/C greasy/G twilight/N he/Q was/V astonished/G to/P see/V another/D human/G finger/N very/A long/A and/C lean/V come/V down/O from/P above/P towards/P the/D broken/G pipe/N and/C hook/N it/Q up/O to/P something/N higher/G ./O
The/D lighted/G aperture/N was/V abruptly/A blackened/V and/C blocked/V ,/O presumably/A by/P a/D face/N and/C mouth/N ,/O for/P something/N human/G spoke/V down/P the/D tube/N ,/O though/P the/D words/N were/V not/A clear/G ./O
``/O Who/Q is/V that/P ?/O ''/O

As/P the/D echoes/N of/P Evan/R 's/O last/G appeal/N rang/V and/C died/V in/P the/D universal/G uproar/N ,/O the/D fiery/N vault/N over/P his/Q head/N opened/V down/O the/D middle/N ,/O and/C ,/O reeling/V back/A in/P two/O great/G golden/G billows/N ,/O hung/V on/P each/D side/N as/P huge/G and/C harmless/G as/P two/O sloping/N hills/N lie/V on/P each/D side/N of/P a/D valley/N ./O
Down/P the/D centre/N of/P this/D trough/N ,/O or/C chasm/N ,/O a/D little/G path/N ran/V ,/O cleared/V of/P all/D but/C ashes/N ,/O and/C down/P this/D little/G path/N was/V walking/V a/D little/G old/G man/N singing/N as/P if/P he/Q were/V alone/A in/P a/D wood/N in/P spring/N ./O
When/O James/R Turnbull/R saw/V this/D he/Q suddenly/A put/V out/O a/D hand/N and/C seemed/V to/P support/V himself/Q on/P the/D strong/G shoulder/N of/P Madeleine/R Durand/R ./O

As/P the/D little/G singing/N figure/N came/V nearer/G and/C nearer/G ,/O Evan/R fell/V on/P his/Q knees/N ,/O and/C after/P an/D instant/N Beatrice/N followed/V ;/O then/A Madeleine/R fell/V on/P her/Q knees/N ,/O and/C after/P a/D longer/A instant/G Turnbull/N followed/V ./O
