CHAPTER/R 1/O
The/D family/N of/P Dashwood/R had/V long/A been/V settled/V in/P Sussex/R ./O
Their/Q estate/N was/V large/G ,/O and/C their/Q residence/N was/V at/P Norland/R Park/R ,/O in/P the/D centre/N of/P their/Q property/N ,/O where/O ,/O for/P many/G generations/N ,/O they/Q had/V lived/V in/P so/A respectable/G a/D manner/N as/P to/P engage/V the/D general/G good/G opinion/N of/P their/Q surrounding/V acquaintance/N ./O
The/D late/G owner/N of/P this/D estate/N was/V a/D single/G man/N ,/O who/Q lived/V to/P a/D very/A advanced/G age/N ,/O and/C who/Q for/P many/G years/N of/P his/Q life/N ,/O had/V a/D constant/G companion/N and/C housekeeper/N in/P his/Q sister/N ./O
But/C her/Q death/N ,/O which/O happened/V ten/O years/N before/P his/Q own/G ,/O produced/V a/D great/G alteration/N in/P his/Q home/N ;/O for/P to/P supply/V her/Q loss/N ,/O he/Q invited/V and/C received/V into/P his/Q house/N the/D family/N of/P his/Q nephew/N Mr./R Henry/R Dashwood/R ,/O the/D legal/G inheritor/N of/P the/D Norland/R estate/N ,/O and/C the/D person/N to/P whom/Q he/Q intended/V to/P bequeath/N it/Q ./O
In/P the/D society/N of/P his/Q nephew/N and/C niece/N ,/O and/C their/Q children/N ,/O the/D old/G Gentleman/N 's/O days/N were/V comfortably/A spent/V ./O
His/Q attachment/N to/P them/Q all/D increased/V ./O
The/D constant/G attention/N of/P Mr./R and/C Mrs./R Henry/R Dashwood/R to/P his/Q wishes/N ,/O which/O proceeded/V not/A merely/A from/P interest/N ,/O but/C from/P goodness/N of/P heart/N ,/O gave/V him/Q every/D degree/N of/P solid/G comfort/N which/O his/Q age/N could/O receive/V ;/O and/C the/D cheerfulness/N of/P the/D children/N added/V a/D relish/N to/P his/Q existence/N ./O
By/P a/D former/G marriage/N ,/O Mr./R Henry/R Dashwood/R had/V one/O son/N :/O by/P his/Q present/G lady/N ,/O three/O daughters/N ./O
The/D son/N ,/O a/D steady/G respectable/G young/G man/N ,/O was/V amply/A provided/V for/P by/P the/D fortune/N of/P his/Q mother/N ,/O which/O had/V been/V large/G ,/O and/C half/N of/P which/O devolved/G on/P him/Q on/P his/Q coming/V of/P age/N ./O
By/P his/Q own/G marriage/N ,/O likewise/A ,/O which/O happened/V soon/A afterwards/A ,/O he/Q added/V to/P his/Q wealth/N ./O
To/P him/Q therefore/A the/D succession/N to/P the/D Norland/R estate/N was/V not/A so/A really/A important/G as/P to/P his/Q sisters/N ;/O for/P their/Q fortune/N ,/O independent/G of/P what/Q might/O arise/V to/P them/Q from/P their/Q father/N 's/O inheriting/N that/P property/N ,/O could/O be/V but/C small/G ./O
Their/Q mother/N had/V nothing/N ,/O and/C their/Q father/N only/A seven/O thousand/O pounds/N in/P his/Q own/G disposal/N ;/O for/P the/D remaining/V moiety/N of/P his/Q first/G wife/N 's/O fortune/N was/V also/A secured/V to/P her/Q child/N ,/O and/C he/Q had/V only/A a/D life-interest/N in/P it/Q ./O
The/D old/G gentleman/N died/V :/O his/Q will/O was/V read/V ,/O and/C like/P almost/A every/D other/G will/N ,/O gave/V as/P much/G disappointment/N as/P pleasure/N ./O
He/Q was/V neither/A so/A unjust/G ,/O nor/C so/A ungrateful/G ,/O as/P to/P leave/V his/Q estate/N from/P his/Q nephew/N ;/O --/O but/C he/Q left/V it/Q to/P him/Q on/P such/G terms/N as/P destroyed/G half/N the/D value/N of/P the/D bequest/N ./O
Mr./R Dashwood/R had/V wished/V for/P it/Q more/A for/P the/D sake/N of/P his/Q wife/N and/C daughters/N than/P for/P himself/Q or/C his/Q son/N ;/O --/O but/C to/P his/Q son/N ,/O and/C his/Q son/N 's/O son/N ,/O a/D child/N of/P four/O years/N old/G ,/O it/Q was/V secured/V ,/O in/P such/D a/D way/N ,/O as/P to/P leave/V to/P himself/Q no/D power/N of/P providing/V for/P those/D who/Q were/V most/A dear/G to/P him/Q ,/O and/C who/Q most/G needed/V a/D provision/N by/P any/D charge/N on/P the/D estate/N ,/O or/C by/P any/D sale/N of/P its/Q valuable/G woods/N ./O
The/D whole/N was/V tied/V up/O for/P the/D benefit/N of/P this/D child/N ,/O who/Q ,/O in/P occasional/G visits/N with/P his/Q father/N and/C mother/N at/P Norland/R ,/O had/V so/A far/A gained/V on/P the/D affections/N of/P his/Q uncle/N ,/O by/P such/G attractions/N as/P are/V by/P no/D means/N unusual/G in/P children/N of/P two/O or/C three/O years/N old/G ;/O an/D imperfect/N articulation/N ,/O an/D earnest/G desire/N of/P having/V his/Q own/G way/N ,/O many/G cunning/N tricks/N ,/O and/C a/D great/G deal/N of/P noise/N ,/O as/P to/P outweigh/V all/D the/D value/N of/P all/D the/D attention/N which/O ,/O for/P years/N ,/O he/Q had/V received/V from/P his/Q niece/N and/C her/Q daughters/N ./O
He/Q meant/V not/A to/P be/V unkind/N ,/O however/A ,/O and/C ,/O as/P a/D mark/N of/P his/Q affection/N for/P the/D three/O girls/N ,/O he/Q left/V them/Q a/D thousand/O pounds/N a-piece/N ./O
Mr./R Dashwood/R 's/O disappointment/N was/V ,/O at/P first/G ,/O severe/G ;/O but/C his/Q temper/N was/V cheerful/G and/C sanguine/G ;/O and/C he/Q might/O reasonably/A hope/V to/P live/V many/G years/N ,/O and/C by/P living/V economically/A ,/O lay/V by/P a/D considerable/G sum/N from/P the/D produce/N of/P an/D estate/N already/A large/G ,/O and/C capable/G of/P almost/A immediate/G improvement/N ./O
But/C the/D fortune/N ,/O which/O had/V been/V so/A tardy/G in/P coming/V ,/O was/V his/Q only/G one/O twelvemonth/N ./O
He/Q survived/V his/Q uncle/N no/A longer/A ;/O and/C ten/O thousand/O pounds/N ,/O including/V the/D late/G legacies/N ,/O was/V all/D that/O remained/V for/P his/Q widow/N and/C daughters/N ./O
His/Q son/N was/V sent/V for/P as/A soon/A as/P his/Q danger/N was/V known/V ,/O and/C to/P him/Q Mr./R Dashwood/R recommended/V ,/O with/P all/D the/D strength/N and/C urgency/N which/O illness/N could/O command/V ,/O the/D interest/N of/P his/Q mother-in-law/N and/C sisters/N ./O
Mr./R John/R Dashwood/R had/V not/A the/D strong/G feelings/N of/P the/D rest/N of/P the/D family/N ;/O but/C he/Q was/V affected/V by/P a/D recommendation/N of/P such/G a/D nature/N at/P such/G a/D time/N ,/O and/C he/Q promised/V to/P do/V every/D thing/N in/P his/Q power/N to/P make/V them/Q comfortable/G ./O
His/Q father/N was/V rendered/V easy/G by/P such/G an/D assurance/N ,/O and/C Mr./R John/R Dashwood/R had/V then/A leisure/N to/P consider/V how/O much/G there/A might/O prudently/A be/V in/P his/Q power/N to/P do/V for/P them/Q ./O
He/Q was/V not/A an/D ill-disposed/G young/G man/N ,/O unless/P to/P be/V rather/A cold/G hearted/V and/C rather/A selfish/G is/V to/P be/V ill-disposed/G :/O but/C he/Q was/V ,/O in/P general/G ,/O well/A respected/V ;/O for/P he/Q conducted/V himself/Q with/P propriety/N in/P the/D discharge/N of/P his/Q ordinary/G duties/N ./O
Had/V he/Q married/V a/D more/A amiable/G woman/N ,/O he/Q might/O have/V been/V made/V still/A more/A respectable/G than/P he/Q was/V :/O --/O he/Q might/O even/A have/V been/V made/V amiable/G himself/Q ;/O for/P he/Q was/V very/A young/G when/O he/Q married/V ,/O and/C very/A fond/G of/P his/Q wife/N ./O
But/C Mrs./R John/R Dashwood/R was/V a/D strong/G caricature/N of/P himself/Q ;/O --/O more/G narrow-minded/G and/C selfish/G ./O
When/O he/Q gave/V his/Q promise/N to/P his/Q father/N ,/O he/Q meditated/V within/P himself/Q to/P increase/V the/D fortunes/N of/P his/Q sisters/N by/P the/D present/G of/P a/D thousand/O pounds/N a-piece/N ./O
He/Q then/A really/A thought/V himself/Q equal/G to/P it/Q ./O
The/D prospect/N of/P four/O thousand/O a-year/N ,/O in/P addition/N to/P his/Q present/G income/N ,/O besides/P the/D remaining/V half/N of/P his/Q own/G mother/N 's/O fortune/N ,/O warmed/V his/Q heart/N ,/O and/C made/V him/Q feel/V capable/G of/P generosity/N ./O
--/O ``/O Yes/O ,/O he/Q would/O give/V them/Q three/O thousand/O pounds/N :/O it/Q would/O be/V liberal/G and/C handsome/G !/O

Three/O thousand/O pounds/N !/O
he/Q could/O spare/V so/A considerable/G a/D sum/N with/P little/G inconvenience/N ./O ''/O
--/O He/Q thought/V of/P it/Q all/D day/N long/A ,/O and/C for/P many/G days/N successively/A ,/O and/C he/Q did/V not/A repent/V ./O
No/D sooner/A was/V his/Q father/N 's/O funeral/N over/P ,/O than/P Mrs./R John/R Dashwood/R ,/O without/P sending/V any/D notice/N of/P her/Q intention/N to/P her/Q mother-in-law/N ,/O arrived/V with/P her/Q child/N and/C their/Q attendants/N ./O
No/D one/N could/O dispute/V her/Q right/N to/P come/V ;/O the/D house/N was/V her/Q husband/N 's/O from/P the/D moment/N of/P his/Q father/N 's/O decease/N ;/O but/C the/D indelicacy/N of/P her/Q conduct/N was/V so/A much/A the/D greater/G ,/O and/C to/P a/D woman/N in/P Mrs./R Dashwood/R 's/O situation/N ,/O with/P only/A common/G feelings/N ,/O must/O have/V been/V highly/A unpleasing/G ;/O --/O but/C in/P HER/R mind/N there/O was/V a/D sense/N of/P honor/N so/P keen/G ,/O a/D generosity/N so/A romantic/G ,/O that/P any/D offence/N of/P the/D kind/N ,/O by/P whomsoever/G given/V or/C received/V ,/O was/V to/P her/Q a/D source/N of/P immoveable/G disgust/N ./O
Mrs./R John/R Dashwood/R had/V never/A been/V a/D favourite/G with/P any/D of/P her/Q husband/N 's/O family/N ;/O but/C she/Q had/V had/V no/D opportunity/N ,/O till/P the/D present/G ,/O of/P shewing/V them/Q with/P how/O little/G attention/N to/P the/D comfort/N of/P other/G people/N she/Q could/O act/V when/O occasion/N required/V it/Q ./O
So/A acutely/A did/V Mrs./R Dashwood/R feel/V this/D ungracious/G behaviour/N ,/O and/C so/A earnestly/A did/V she/Q despise/V her/Q daughter-in-law/N for/P it/Q ,/O that/P ,/O on/P the/D arrival/N of/P the/D latter/G ,/O she/Q would/O have/V quitted/V the/D house/N for/P ever/A ,/O had/V not/A the/D entreaty/N of/P her/Q eldest/G girl/N induced/V her/Q first/G to/P reflect/V on/P the/D propriety/N of/P going/V ,/O and/C her/Q own/G tender/N love/N for/P all/D her/Q three/O children/N determined/V her/Q afterwards/A to/P stay/V ,/O and/C for/P their/Q sakes/N avoid/V a/D breach/N with/P their/Q brother/N ./O
Elinor/R ,/O this/D eldest/G daughter/N ,/O whose/Q advice/N was/V so/A effectual/G ,/O possessed/V a/D strength/N of/P understanding/N ,/O and/C coolness/N of/P judgment/N ,/O which/O qualified/V her/Q ,/O though/P only/A nineteen/O ,/O to/P be/V the/D counsellor/N of/P her/Q mother/N ,/O and/C enabled/V her/Q frequently/A to/P counteract/N ,/O to/P the/D advantage/N of/P them/Q all/D ,/O that/P eagerness/N of/P mind/N in/P Mrs./R Dashwood/R which/O must/O generally/A have/V led/V to/P imprudence/N ./O
She/Q had/V an/D excellent/G heart/N ;/O --/O her/Q disposition/N was/V affectionate/G ,/O and/C her/Q feelings/N were/V strong/G ;/O but/C she/Q knew/V how/O to/P govern/V them/Q :/O it/Q was/V a/D knowledge/N which/O her/Q mother/N had/V yet/A to/P learn/V ;/O and/C which/O one/O of/P her/Q sisters/N had/V resolved/V never/A to/P be/V taught/V ./O
Marianne/R 's/O abilities/N were/V ,/O in/P many/G respects/N ,/O quite/A equal/G to/P Elinor/R 's/O ./O

Margaret/R ,/O the/D other/G sister/N ,/O was/V a/D good-humored/G ,/O well-disposed/G girl/N ;/O but/C as/P she/Q had/V already/A imbibed/V a/D good/G deal/N of/P Marianne/R 's/O romance/N ,/O without/P having/V much/G of/P her/Q sense/N ,/O she/Q did/V not/A ,/O at/P thirteen/O ,/O bid/N fair/N to/P equal/V her/Q sisters/N at/P a/D more/A advanced/G period/N of/P life/N ./O
CHAPTER/N 2/O Mrs./R John/R Dashwood/R now/A installed/V herself/Q mistress/N of/P Norland/R ;/O and/C her/Q mother/N and/C sisters-in-law/N were/V degraded/V to/P the/D condition/N of/P visitors/N ./O
As/P such/G ,/O however/A ,/O they/Q were/V treated/V by/P her/Q with/P quiet/G civility/N ;/O and/C by/P her/Q husband/N with/P as/A much/G kindness/N as/P he/Q could/O feel/V towards/P anybody/N beyond/P himself/Q ,/O his/Q wife/N ,/O and/C their/Q child/N ./O
He/Q really/A pressed/V them/Q ,/O with/P some/D earnestness/N ,/O to/P consider/V Norland/R as/P their/Q home/N ;/O and/C ,/O as/P no/D plan/N appeared/V so/A eligible/G to/P Mrs./R Dashwood/R as/P remaining/V there/A till/P she/Q could/O accommodate/V herself/Q with/P a/D house/N in/P the/D neighbourhood/N ,/O his/Q invitation/N was/V accepted/V ./O
A/D continuance/N in/P a/D place/N where/O everything/N reminded/V her/Q of/P former/G delight/N ,/O was/V exactly/A what/Q suited/V her/Q mind/N ./O

Mrs./R John/R Dashwood/R did/V not/A at/P all/D approve/V of/P what/Q her/Q husband/N intended/V to/P do/V for/P his/Q sisters/N ./O
To/P take/V three/O thousand/O pounds/N from/P the/D fortune/N of/P their/Q dear/G little/G boy/N would/O be/V impoverishing/V him/Q to/P the/D most/A dreadful/G degree/N ./O

The/D situation/N of/P Barton/R ,/O in/P a/D county/N so/A far/A distant/G from/P Sussex/R as/P Devonshire/R ,/O which/O ,/O but/C a/D few/G hours/N before/P ,/O would/O have/V been/V a/D sufficient/G objection/N to/P outweigh/V every/D possible/G advantage/N belonging/N to/P the/D place/N ,/O was/V now/A its/Q first/G recommendation/N ./O
To/P quit/V the/D neighbourhood/N of/P Norland/R was/V no/A longer/A an/D evil/N ;/O it/Q was/V an/D object/N of/P desire/N ;/O it/Q was/V a/D blessing/N ,/O in/P comparison/N of/P the/D misery/N of/P continuing/V her/Q daughter-in-law/N 's/O guest/N ;/O and/C to/P remove/V for/P ever/A from/P that/D beloved/G place/N would/O be/V less/A painful/G than/P to/P inhabit/V or/C visit/V it/Q while/P such/G a/D woman/N was/V its/Q mistress/N ./O
She/Q instantly/A wrote/V Sir/R John/R Middleton/R her/Q acknowledgment/N of/P his/Q kindness/N ,/O and/C her/Q acceptance/N of/P his/Q proposal/N ;/O and/C then/A hastened/V to/P shew/V both/D letters/N to/P her/Q daughters/N ,/O that/P she/Q might/O be/V secure/G of/P their/Q approbation/N before/P her/Q answer/N were/V sent/V ./O

It/Q was/V necessary/G to/P the/D happiness/N of/P both/D ;/O for/P however/A dissimilar/G in/P temper/N and/C outward/G behaviour/N ,/O they/Q strongly/A resembled/V each/D other/G in/P that/D total/G want/N of/P talent/N and/C taste/V which/O confined/V their/Q employments/N ,/O unconnected/G with/P such/G as/P society/N produced/V ,/O within/P a/D very/A narrow/G compass/N ./O
Sir/R John/R was/V a/D sportsman/N ,/O Lady/R Middleton/R a/D mother/N ./O

Lady/R Middleton/R piqued/V herself/Q upon/P the/D elegance/N of/P her/Q table/N ,/O and/C of/P all/D her/Q domestic/G arrangements/N ;/O and/C from/P this/D kind/N of/P vanity/N was/V her/Q greatest/G enjoyment/N in/P any/D of/P their/Q parties/N ./O

The/D arrival/N of/P a/D new/G family/N in/P the/D country/N was/V always/A a/D matter/N of/P joy/N to/P him/Q ,/O and/C in/P every/D point/N of/P view/N he/Q was/V charmed/V with/P the/D inhabitants/N he/Q had/V now/A procured/V for/P his/Q cottage/N at/P Barton/R ./O
The/D Miss/R Dashwoods/N were/V young/G ,/O pretty/A ,/O and/C unaffected/G ./O
It/Q was/V enough/A to/P secure/V his/Q good/G opinion/N ;/O for/P to/P be/V unaffected/V was/V all/D that/P a/D pretty/G girl/N could/O want/V to/P make/V her/Q mind/N as/P captivating/V as/P her/Q person/N ./O

In/P showing/V kindness/N to/P his/Q cousins/N therefore/A he/Q had/V the/D real/G satisfaction/N of/P a/D good/G heart/N ;/O and/C in/P settling/V a/D family/N of/P females/N only/A in/P his/Q cottage/N ,/O he/Q had/V all/D the/D satisfaction/N of/P a/D sportsman/N ;/O for/P a/D sportsman/N ,/O though/P he/Q esteems/V only/A those/D of/P his/Q sex/N who/Q are/V sportsmen/N likewise/A ,/O is/V not/A often/A desirous/G of/P encouraging/V their/Q taste/N by/P admitting/V them/Q to/P a/D residence/N within/P his/Q own/G manor/N ./O
Mrs./R Dashwood/R and/C her/Q daughters/N were/V met/V at/P the/D door/N of/P the/D house/N by/P Sir/R John/R ,/O who/Q welcomed/V them/Q to/P Barton/R Park/R with/P unaffected/G sincerity/N ;/O and/C as/P he/Q attended/V them/Q to/P the/D drawing/N room/N repeated/V to/P the/D young/G ladies/N the/D concern/N which/O the/D same/G subject/N had/V drawn/V from/P him/Q the/D day/N before/P ,/O at/P being/V unable/G to/P get/V any/D smart/G young/G men/N to/P meet/V them/Q ./O
They/Q would/O see/V ,/O he/Q said/V ,/O only/A one/O gentleman/N there/A besides/P himself/Q ;/O a/D particular/G friend/N who/Q was/V staying/V at/P the/D park/N ,/O but/C who/Q was/V neither/D very/A young/G nor/C very/A gay/G ./O
He/Q hoped/V they/Q would/O all/D excuse/V the/D smallness/N of/P the/D party/N ,/O and/C could/O assure/V them/Q it/Q should/O never/A happen/V so/A again/A ./O
He/Q had/V been/V to/P several/G families/N that/O morning/N in/P hopes/N of/P procuring/V some/D addition/N to/P their/Q number/N ,/O but/C it/Q was/V moonlight/N and/C every/D body/N was/V full/G of/P engagements/N ./O
Luckily/R Lady/R Middleton/R 's/O mother/N had/V arrived/V at/P Barton/R within/P the/D last/G hour/N ,/O and/C as/P she/Q was/V a/D very/A cheerful/G agreeable/G woman/N ,/O he/Q hoped/V the/D young/G ladies/N would/O not/A find/V it/Q so/A very/A dull/G as/P they/Q might/O imagine/V ./O
The/D young/G ladies/N ,/O as/A well/A as/P their/Q mother/N ,/O were/V perfectly/A satisfied/V with/P having/V two/O entire/G strangers/N of/P the/D party/N ,/O and/C wished/V for/P no/D more/G ./O
Mrs./R Jennings/R ,/O Lady/R Middleton/R 's/O mother/N ,/O was/V a/D good-humoured/G ,/O merry/N ,/O fat/G ,/O elderly/G woman/N ,/O who/Q talked/V a/D great/G deal/N ,/O seemed/V very/A happy/G ,/O and/C rather/A vulgar/N ./O
She/Q was/V full/G of/P jokes/N and/C laughter/N ,/O and/C before/P dinner/N was/V over/A had/V said/V many/G witty/P things/N on/P the/D subject/N of/P lovers/N and/C husbands/N ;/O hoped/V they/Q had/V not/A left/V their/Q hearts/N behind/P them/Q in/P Sussex/N ,/O and/C pretended/V to/P see/V them/Q blush/G whether/P they/Q did/V or/C not/A ./O
Marianne/R was/V vexed/V at/P it/Q for/P her/Q sister/N 's/O sake/N ,/O and/C turned/V her/Q eyes/N towards/P Elinor/G to/P see/V how/O she/Q bore/V these/D attacks/N ,/O with/P an/D earnestness/N which/O gave/V Elinor/R far/A more/G pain/N than/P could/O arise/V from/P such/G common-place/G raillery/N as/P Mrs./R Jennings/R 's/O ./O
Colonel/R Brandon/R ,/O the/D friend/N of/P Sir/R John/R ,/O seemed/V no/D more/G adapted/V by/P resemblance/N of/P manner/N to/P be/V his/Q friend/N ,/O than/P Lady/R Middleton/R was/V to/P be/V his/Q wife/N ,/O or/C Mrs./R Jennings/R to/P be/V Lady/R Middleton/R 's/O mother/N ./O
He/Q was/V silent/G and/C grave/G ./O
His/Q appearance/N however/A was/V not/A unpleasing/G ,/O in/P spite/N of/P his/Q being/V in/P the/D opinion/N of/P Marianne/R and/C Margaret/R an/D absolute/G old/G bachelor/N ,/O for/P he/Q was/V on/P the/D wrong/G side/N of/P five/O and/C thirty/O ;/O but/C though/P his/Q face/N was/V not/A handsome/G ,/O his/Q countenance/N was/V sensible/G ,/O and/C his/Q address/N was/V particularly/A gentlemanlike/G ./O
There/O was/V nothing/N in/P any/D of/P the/D party/N which/O could/O recommend/V them/Q as/P companions/N to/P the/D Dashwoods/N ;/O but/C the/D cold/G insipidity/N of/P Lady/R Middleton/R was/V so/A particularly/A repulsive/G ,/O that/P in/P comparison/N of/P it/Q the/D gravity/N of/P Colonel/R Brandon/R ,/O and/C even/A the/D boisterous/G mirth/N of/P Sir/R John/R and/C his/Q mother-in-law/N was/V interesting/G ./O
Lady/R Middleton/R seemed/V to/P be/V roused/V to/P enjoyment/N only/A by/P the/D entrance/N of/P her/Q four/O noisy/G children/N after/P dinner/N ,/O who/Q pulled/V her/Q about/A ,/O tore/V her/Q clothes/N ,/O and/C put/V an/D end/N to/P every/D kind/N of/P discourse/N except/P what/Q related/V to/P themselves/Q ./O

His/Q pleasure/N in/P music/N ,/O though/P it/Q amounted/V not/A to/P that/D ecstatic/G delight/N which/O alone/A could/O sympathize/V with/P her/Q own/G ,/O was/V estimable/G when/O contrasted/V against/P the/D horrible/G insensibility/N of/P the/D others/N ;/O and/C she/Q was/V reasonable/G enough/A to/P allow/V that/P a/D man/N of/P five/O and/C thirty/O might/O well/A have/V outlived/V all/D acuteness/N of/P feeling/N and/C every/D exquisite/G power/N of/P enjoyment/N ./O

If/P in/P the/D supposition/N of/P his/Q seeking/V to/P marry/V herself/Q ,/O his/Q difficulties/N from/P his/Q mother/N had/V seemed/V great/G ,/O how/O much/G greater/G were/V they/Q now/A likely/G to/P be/V ,/O when/O the/D object/N of/P his/Q engagement/N was/V undoubtedly/A inferior/G in/P connections/N ,/O and/C probably/A inferior/G in/P fortune/N to/P herself/Q ./O

From/P their/Q counsel/N ,/O or/C their/Q conversation/N ,/O she/Q knew/V she/Q could/O receive/V no/D assistance/N ,/O their/Q tenderness/N and/C sorrow/N must/O add/V to/P her/Q distress/N ,/O while/P her/Q self-command/N would/O neither/A receive/V encouragement/N from/P their/Q example/N nor/C from/P their/Q praise/N ./O

Much/G as/P she/Q had/V suffered/V from/P her/Q first/G conversation/N with/P Lucy/R on/P the/D subject/N ,/O she/Q soon/A felt/V an/D earnest/G wish/N of/P renewing/V it/Q ;/O and/C this/D for/P more/G reasons/N than/P one/O ./O
She/Q wanted/V to/P hear/V many/G particulars/N of/P their/Q engagement/N repeated/V again/A ,/O she/Q wanted/V more/G clearly/A to/P understand/V what/Q Lucy/R really/A felt/V for/P Edward/R ,/O whether/P there/O were/V any/D sincerity/N in/P her/Q declaration/N of/P tender/N regard/N for/P him/Q ,/O and/C she/Q particularly/A wanted/V to/P convince/V Lucy/R ,/O by/P her/Q readiness/N to/P enter/V on/P the/D matter/N again/A ,/O and/C her/Q calmness/N in/P conversing/V on/P it/Q ,/O that/P she/Q was/V no/D otherwise/A interested/G in/P it/Q than/P as/P a/D friend/N ,/O which/O she/Q very/A much/A feared/V her/Q involuntary/G agitation/N ,/O in/P their/Q morning/N discourse/N ,/O must/O have/V left/V at/P least/G doubtful/G ./O
That/D Lucy/R was/V disposed/V to/P be/V jealous/G of/P her/Q appeared/V very/A probable/G :/O it/Q was/V plain/G that/P Edward/R had/V always/A spoken/V highly/A in/P her/Q praise/N ,/O not/A merely/A from/P Lucy/R 's/O assertion/N ,/O but/C from/P her/Q venturing/N to/P trust/V her/Q on/O so/A short/A a/D personal/G acquaintance/N ,/O with/P a/D secret/G so/P confessedly/G and/C evidently/A important/G ./O

But/C indeed/A ,/O while/P Elinor/R remained/V so/A well/A assured/V within/P herself/Q of/P being/V really/A beloved/G by/P Edward/R ,/O it/Q required/V no/D other/G consideration/N of/P probabilities/N to/P make/V it/Q natural/G that/P Lucy/R should/O be/V jealous/G ;/O and/C that/P she/Q was/V so/A ,/O her/Q very/A confidence/N was/V a/D proof/N ./O
What/Q other/G reason/N for/P the/D disclosure/N of/P the/D affair/N could/O there/A be/V ,/O but/C that/P Elinor/R might/O be/V informed/V by/P it/Q of/P Lucy/R 's/O superior/G claims/N on/P Edward/R ,/O and/C be/V taught/V to/P avoid/V him/Q in/P future/N ?/O
She/Q had/V little/G difficulty/N in/P understanding/V thus/A much/G of/P her/Q rival/N 's/O intentions/N ,/O and/C while/P she/Q was/V firmly/A resolved/V to/P act/V by/P her/Q as/A every/D principle/N of/P honour/N and/C honesty/N directed/V ,/O to/P combat/V her/Q own/G affection/N for/P Edward/R and/C to/P see/V him/Q as/A little/G as/P possible/G ;/O she/Q could/O not/A deny/V herself/Q the/D comfort/N of/P endeavouring/V to/P convince/V Lucy/R that/P her/Q heart/N was/V unwounded/V ./O
And/C as/P she/Q could/O now/A have/V nothing/N more/G painful/G to/P hear/V on/P the/D subject/N than/P had/V already/A been/V told/V ,/O she/Q did/V not/A mistrust/V her/Q own/G ability/N of/P going/V through/P a/D repetition/N of/P particulars/N with/P composure/N ./O
But/C it/Q was/V not/A immediately/A that/P an/D opportunity/N of/P doing/V so/A could/O be/V commanded/V ,/O though/P Lucy/R was/V as/A well/A disposed/V as/P herself/Q to/P take/V advantage/N of/P any/D that/O occurred/V ;/O for/P the/D weather/N was/V not/A often/A fine/G enough/A to/P allow/V of/P their/Q joining/V in/P a/D walk/N ,/O where/O they/Q might/O most/A easily/A separate/G themselves/Q from/P the/D others/N ;/O and/C though/P they/Q met/V at/P least/G every/D other/G evening/N either/C at/P the/D park/N or/C cottage/N ,/O and/C chiefly/A at/P the/D former/G ,/O they/Q could/O not/A be/V supposed/V to/P meet/V for/P the/D sake/N of/P conversation/N ./O
Such/D a/D thought/N would/O never/A enter/V either/D Sir/R John/R or/C Lady/R Middleton/R 's/O head/N ;/O and/C therefore/A very/A little/G leisure/N was/V ever/A given/V for/P a/D general/G chat/N ,/O and/C none/N at/P all/D for/P particular/G discourse/N ./O

One/O or/C two/O meetings/N of/P this/D kind/N had/V taken/V place/N ,/O without/P affording/V Elinor/R any/D chance/N of/P engaging/V Lucy/R in/P private/G ,/O when/O Sir/R John/R called/V at/P the/D cottage/N one/O morning/N ,/O to/P beg/V ,/O in/P the/D name/N of/P charity/N ,/O that/P they/Q would/O all/D dine/N with/P Lady/R Middleton/R that/P day/N ,/O as/P he/Q was/V obliged/V to/P attend/V the/D club/N at/P Exeter/R ,/O and/C she/Q would/O otherwise/A be/V quite/A alone/A ,/O except/P her/Q mother/N and/C the/D two/O Miss/R Steeles/R ./O

Every/D thing/N was/V silent/G ;/O this/D could/O not/A be/V borne/V many/G seconds/N ;/O she/Q opened/V the/D door/N ,/O advanced/V a/D few/G steps/N towards/P the/D stairs/N ,/O and/C after/P listening/V half/N a/D minute/N ,/O returned/V into/P the/D room/N in/P all/D the/D agitation/N which/O a/D conviction/N of/P having/V heard/V him/Q would/O naturally/A produce/V ;/O in/P the/D ecstasy/N of/P her/Q feelings/N at/P that/D instant/N she/Q could/O not/A help/V exclaiming/V ,/O ``/O Oh/O ,/O Elinor/R ,/O it/Q is/V Willoughby/R ,/O indeed/A it/Q is/V !/O ''/O

It/Q was/V too/A great/G a/D shock/N to/P be/V borne/V with/P calmness/N ,/O and/C she/Q immediately/A left/V the/D room/N ./O
Elinor/R was/V disappointed/V too/A ;/O but/C at/P the/D same/G time/N her/Q regard/V for/P Colonel/R Brandon/R ensured/V his/Q welcome/G with/P her/Q ;/O and/C she/Q felt/V particularly/A hurt/V that/P a/D man/N so/A partial/G to/P her/Q sister/N should/O perceive/V that/P she/Q experienced/V nothing/N but/C grief/N and/C disappointment/N in/P seeing/V him/Q ./O

In/P this/D calm/G kind/N of/P way/N ,/O with/P very/A little/G interest/N on/P either/D side/N ,/O they/Q continued/V to/P talk/V ,/O both/D of/P them/Q out/P of/P spirits/N ,/O and/C the/D thoughts/N of/P both/D engaged/V elsewhere/A ./O
Elinor/R wished/V very/A much/A to/P ask/V whether/P Willoughby/R were/V then/A in/P town/N ,/O but/C she/Q was/V afraid/G of/P giving/V him/Q pain/N by/P any/D enquiry/N after/P his/Q rival/N ;/O and/C at/P length/N ,/O by/P way/N of/P saying/V something/N ,/O she/Q asked/V if/P he/Q had/V been/V in/P London/R ever/A since/P she/Q had/V seen/V him/Q last/G ./O

She/Q sat/V by/P the/D drawing-room/N fire/N after/P tea/N ,/O till/P the/D moment/N of/P Lady/R Middleton/R 's/O arrival/N ,/O without/P once/A stirring/V from/P her/Q seat/N ,/O or/C altering/V her/Q attitude/N ,/O lost/V in/P her/Q own/G thoughts/N ,/O and/C insensible/G of/P her/Q sister/N 's/O presence/N ;/O and/C when/O at/P last/G they/Q were/V told/V that/P Lady/R Middleton/R waited/V for/P them/Q at/P the/D door/N ,/O she/Q started/V as/P if/P she/Q had/V forgotten/V that/P any/D one/O was/V expected/V ./O

After/P some/D time/N spent/V in/P saying/V little/G or/C doing/V less/G ,/O Lady/R Middleton/R sat/V down/A to/P Cassino/N ,/O and/C as/P Marianne/R was/V not/A in/P spirits/N for/P moving/V about/A ,/O she/Q and/C Elinor/R luckily/A succeeding/V to/P chairs/N ,/O placed/V themselves/Q at/P no/D great/G distance/N from/P the/D table/N ./O
They/Q had/V not/A remained/V in/P this/D manner/N long/G ,/O before/P Elinor/R perceived/V Willoughby/R ,/O standing/N within/P a/D few/G yards/N of/P them/Q ,/O in/P earnest/G conversation/N with/P a/D very/A fashionable/G looking/V young/G woman/N ./O
She/Q soon/A caught/V his/Q eye/N ,/O and/C he/Q immediately/A bowed/V ,/O but/C without/P attempting/V to/P speak/V to/P her/Q ,/O or/C to/P approach/V Marianne/R ,/O though/P he/Q could/O not/A but/A see/V her/Q ;/O and/C then/A continued/V his/Q discourse/N with/P the/D same/G lady/N ./O

In/P a/D short/G time/N Elinor/R saw/V Willoughby/R quit/V the/D room/N by/P the/D door/N towards/P the/D staircase/N ,/O and/C telling/V Marianne/R that/P he/Q was/V gone/V ,/O urged/V the/D impossibility/N of/P speaking/V to/P him/Q again/A that/P evening/N ,/O as/P a/D fresh/G argument/N for/P her/Q to/P be/V calm/G ./O

The/D intelligence/N however/A ,/O which/O SHE/R would/O not/A give/V ,/O soon/A flowed/V from/P another/D quarter/N ./O

The/D expectation/N of/P seeing/V HER/R ,/O however/A ,/O was/V enough/A to/P make/V her/Q interested/G in/P the/D engagement/N ;/O for/P though/P she/Q could/O now/A meet/V Edward/R 's/O mother/N without/P that/D strong/G anxiety/N which/O had/V once/A promised/V to/P attend/V such/G an/D introduction/N ,/O though/P she/Q could/O now/A see/V her/Q with/P perfect/G indifference/N as/P to/P her/Q opinion/N of/P herself/Q ,/O her/Q desire/N of/P being/V in/P company/N with/P Mrs./R Ferrars/R ,/O her/Q curiosity/N to/P know/V what/Q she/Q was/V like/P ,/O was/V as/A lively/G as/P ever/A ./O

This/D event/N ,/O highly/A important/G to/P Mrs./R Jennings/R 's/O happiness/N ,/O produced/V a/D temporary/G alteration/N in/P the/D disposal/N of/P her/Q time/N ,/O and/C influenced/V ,/O in/P a/D like/G degree/N ,/O the/D engagements/N of/P her/Q young/G friends/N ;/O for/P as/P she/Q wished/V to/P be/V as/A much/G as/P possible/G with/P Charlotte/R ,/O she/Q went/V thither/G every/D morning/N as/A soon/A as/P she/Q was/V dressed/V ,/O and/C did/V not/A return/V till/P late/G in/P the/D evening/N ;/O and/C the/D Miss/R Dashwoods/R ,/O at/P the/D particular/G request/N of/P the/D Middletons/R ,/O spent/V the/D whole/G of/P every/D day/N ,/O in/P every/D day/N in/P Conduit/R Street/R ./O
For/P their/Q own/G comfort/N they/Q would/O much/A rather/A have/V remained/V ,/O at/P least/G all/D the/D morning/N ,/O in/P Mrs./R Jennings/R 's/O house/N ;/O but/C it/Q was/V not/A a/D thing/N to/P be/V urged/V against/P the/D wishes/N of/P everybody/N ./O
Their/Q hours/N were/V therefore/A made/V over/P to/P Lady/R Middleton/R and/C the/D two/O Miss/R Steeles/R ,/O by/P whom/Q their/Q company/N ,/O in/P fact/N was/V as/P little/G valued/V ,/O as/P it/Q was/V professedly/A sought/V ./O

Miss/R Steele/R was/V the/D least/G discomposed/N of/P the/D three/O ,/O by/P their/Q presence/N ;/O and/C it/Q was/V in/P their/Q power/N to/P reconcile/V her/Q to/P it/Q entirely/A ./O

All/D these/D jealousies/N and/C discontents/N ,/O however/A ,/O were/V so/A totally/A unsuspected/G by/P Mrs./R Jennings/R ,/O that/P she/Q thought/V it/Q a/D delightful/G thing/N for/P the/D girls/N to/P be/V together/A ;/O and/C generally/A congratulated/V her/Q young/G friends/N every/D night/N ,/O on/P having/V escaped/V the/D company/N of/P a/D stupid/G old/G woman/N so/A long/A ./O

One/O thing/N DID/R disturb/V her/Q ;/O and/C of/P that/D she/Q made/V her/Q daily/G complaint/N ./O

I/Q come/V now/A to/P the/D relation/N of/P a/D misfortune/N ,/O which/O about/P this/D time/N befell/O Mrs./R John/R Dashwood/R ./O
It/Q so/A happened/V that/P while/P her/Q two/O sisters/N with/P Mrs./R Jennings/R were/V first/A calling/V on/P her/Q in/P Harley/R Street/R ,/O another/D of/P her/Q acquaintance/N had/V dropt/N in/P --/O a/D circumstance/N in/P itself/Q not/A apparently/A likely/G to/P produce/V evil/G to/P her/Q ./O
But/C while/P the/D imaginations/N of/P other/G people/N will/O carry/V them/Q away/A to/P form/V wrong/G judgments/N of/P our/Q conduct/N ,/O and/C to/P decide/V on/P it/Q by/P slight/G appearances/N ,/O one/O 's/O happiness/N must/O in/P some/D measure/N be/V always/A at/P the/D mercy/N of/P chance/N ./O
In/P the/D present/G instance/N ,/O this/D last-arrived/G lady/N allowed/V her/Q fancy/G to/P so/A far/A outrun/G truth/N and/C probability/N ,/O that/O on/P merely/A hearing/V the/D name/N of/P the/D Miss/R Dashwoods/R ,/O and/C understanding/V them/Q to/P be/V Mr./R Dashwood/R 's/O sisters/N ,/O she/Q immediately/A concluded/V them/Q to/P be/V staying/V in/P Harley/R Street/R ;/O and/C this/D misconstruction/N produced/V within/P a/D day/N or/C two/O afterwards/A ,/O cards/N of/P invitation/N for/P them/Q as/A well/A as/P for/P their/Q brother/N and/C sister/N ,/O to/P a/D small/G musical/G party/N at/P her/Q house/N ./O

In/P such/G moments/N of/P precious/G ,/O invaluable/G misery/N ,/O she/Q rejoiced/V in/P tears/N of/P agony/N to/P be/V at/P Cleveland/R ;/O and/C as/P she/Q returned/V by/P a/D different/G circuit/N to/P the/D house/N ,/O feeling/V all/D the/D happy/G privilege/N of/P country/N liberty/N ,/O of/P wandering/V from/P place/N to/P place/V in/P free/G and/C luxurious/G solitude/N ,/O she/Q resolved/V to/P spend/V almost/A every/D hour/N of/P every/D day/N while/P she/Q remained/V with/P the/D Palmers/N ,/O in/P the/D indulgence/N of/P such/G solitary/G rambles/N ./O

The/D morning/N was/V fine/G and/C dry/G ,/O and/C Marianne/R ,/O in/P her/Q plan/N of/P employment/N abroad/A ,/O had/V not/A calculated/V for/P any/D change/N of/P weather/N during/P their/Q stay/N at/P Cleveland/R ./O
With/P great/G surprise/N therefore/A ,/O did/V she/Q find/V herself/Q prevented/V by/P a/D settled/V rain/N from/P going/V out/O again/A after/P dinner/N ./O
She/Q had/V depended/V on/P a/D twilight/G walk/N to/P the/D Grecian/R temple/N ,/O and/C perhaps/A all/D over/P the/D grounds/N ,/O and/C an/D evening/N merely/A cold/G or/C damp/N would/O not/A have/V deterred/V her/Q from/P it/Q ;/O but/C a/D heavy/G and/C settled/V rain/N even/A SHE/D could/O not/A fancy/G dry/G or/C pleasant/G weather/N for/P walking/N ./O
Their/Q party/N was/V small/G ,/O and/C the/D hours/N passed/V quietly/A away/A ./O
Mrs./R Palmer/R had/V her/Q child/N ,/O and/C Mrs./R Jennings/R her/Q carpet-work/N ;/O they/Q talked/V of/P the/D friends/N they/Q had/V left/V behind/P ,/O arranged/V Lady/R Middleton/R 's/O engagements/N ,/O and/C wondered/V whether/P Mr./R Palmer/R and/C Colonel/R Brandon/R would/O get/V farther/A than/P Reading/V that/D night/N ./O
Elinor/R ,/O however/A little/G concerned/G in/P it/Q ,/O joined/V in/P their/Q discourse/N ;/O and/C Marianne/R ,/O who/Q had/V the/D knack/N of/P finding/V her/Q way/N in/P every/D house/N to/P the/D library/N ,/O however/A it/Q might/O be/V avoided/V by/P the/D family/N in/P general/G ,/O soon/A procured/V herself/Q a/D book/N ./O
Nothing/N was/V wanting/V on/P Mrs./R Palmer/R 's/O side/N that/P constant/G and/C friendly/G good/G humour/N could/O do/V ,/O to/P make/V them/Q feel/V themselves/Q welcome/G ./O
The/D openness/N and/C heartiness/N of/P her/Q manner/N more/G than/P atoned/V for/P that/D want/N of/P recollection/N and/C elegance/N which/O made/V her/Q often/A deficient/G in/P the/D forms/N of/P politeness/N ;/O her/Q kindness/N ,/O recommended/V by/P so/A pretty/A a/D face/N ,/O was/V engaging/V ;/O her/Q folly/N ,/O though/P evident/G was/V not/A disgusting/G ,/O because/P it/Q was/V not/A conceited/V ;/O and/C Elinor/R could/O have/V forgiven/V every/D thing/N but/C her/Q laugh/N ./O
The/D two/O gentlemen/N arrived/V the/D next/G day/N to/P a/D very/A late/G dinner/N ,/O affording/V a/D pleasant/G enlargement/N of/P the/D party/N ,/O and/C a/D very/A welcome/G variety/N to/P their/Q conversation/N ,/O which/O a/D long/G morning/N of/P the/D same/G continued/G rain/N had/V reduced/V very/A low/G ./O
Elinor/R had/V seen/V so/A little/G of/P Mr./R Palmer/R ,/O and/C in/P that/D little/G had/V seen/V so/A much/G variety/N in/P his/Q address/N to/P her/Q sister/N and/C herself/Q ,/O that/P she/Q knew/V not/A what/Q to/P expect/V to/P find/V him/Q in/P his/Q own/G family/N ./O
She/Q found/V him/Q ,/O however/A ,/O perfectly/A the/D gentleman/N in/P his/Q behaviour/N to/P all/D his/Q visitors/N ,/O and/C only/A occasionally/A rude/G to/P his/Q wife/N and/C her/Q mother/N ;/O she/Q found/V him/Q very/A capable/G of/P being/V a/D pleasant/G companion/N ,/O and/C only/A prevented/V from/P being/V so/A always/A ,/O by/P too/A great/G an/D aptitude/N to/P fancy/G himself/Q as/P much/G superior/G to/P people/N in/P general/G ,/O as/P he/Q must/O feel/V himself/Q to/P be/V to/P Mrs./R Jennings/R and/C Charlotte/R ./O
For/P the/D rest/N of/P his/Q character/N and/C habits/N ,/O they/Q were/V marked/V ,/O as/A far/A as/P Elinor/R could/O perceive/V ,/O with/P no/D traits/N at/P all/D unusual/G in/P his/Q sex/N and/C time/N of/P life/N ./O
He/Q was/V nice/G in/P his/Q eating/N ,/O uncertain/G in/P his/Q hours/N ;/O fond/N of/P his/Q child/N ,/O though/P affecting/V to/P slight/G it/Q ;/O and/C idled/V away/O the/D mornings/N at/P billiards/N ,/O which/O ought/O to/P have/V been/V devoted/V to/P business/N ./O
She/Q liked/V him/Q ,/O however/A ,/O upon/P the/D whole/G ,/O much/G better/G than/P she/Q had/V expected/V ,/O and/C in/P her/Q heart/N was/V not/A sorry/G that/P she/Q could/O like/V him/Q no/D more/A ;/O --/O not/A sorry/G to/P be/V driven/V by/P the/D observation/N of/P his/Q Epicurism/N ,/O his/Q selfishness/N ,/O and/C his/Q conceit/N ,/O to/P rest/V with/P complacency/N on/P the/D remembrance/N of/P Edward/R 's/O generous/G temper/N ,/O simple/G taste/N ,/O and/C diffident/G feelings/N ./O

Mrs./R Jennings/N had/V determined/V very/A early/A in/P the/D seizure/N that/P Marianne/R would/O never/A get/V over/P it/Q ,/O and/C Colonel/R Brandon/R ,/O who/Q was/V chiefly/A of/P use/N in/P listening/V to/P Mrs./R Jennings/R 's/O forebodings/N ,/O was/V not/A in/P a/D state/N of/P mind/N to/P resist/V their/Q influence/N ./O
He/Q tried/V to/P reason/V himself/Q out/P of/P fears/N ,/O which/O the/D different/G judgment/N of/P the/D apothecary/N seemed/V to/P render/V absurd/G ;/O but/C the/D many/G hours/N of/P each/D day/N in/P which/O he/Q was/V left/V entirely/A alone/A ,/O were/V but/C too/A favourable/G for/P the/D admission/N of/P every/D melancholy/G idea/N ,/O and/C he/Q could/O not/A expel/V from/P his/Q mind/N the/D persuasion/N that/P he/Q should/O see/V Marianne/R no/D more/A ./O
On/P the/D morning/N of/P the/D third/G day/N however/A ,/O the/D gloomy/G anticipations/N of/P both/D were/V almost/A done/V away/A ;/O for/P when/O Mr./R Harris/R arrived/V ,/O he/Q declared/V his/Q patient/N materially/A better/A ./O
Her/Q pulse/N was/V much/G stronger/G ,/O and/C every/D symptom/N more/A favourable/G than/P on/P the/D preceding/V visit/N ./O
Elinor/R ,/O confirmed/V in/P every/D pleasant/G hope/N ,/O was/V all/D cheerfulness/N ;/O rejoicing/V that/P in/P her/Q letters/N to/P her/Q mother/N ,/O she/Q had/V pursued/V her/Q own/G judgment/N rather/A than/P her/Q friend/N 's/O ,/O in/P making/V very/A light/G of/P the/D indisposition/N which/O delayed/V them/Q at/P Cleveland/R ;/O and/C almost/A fixing/V on/P the/D time/N when/O Marianne/R would/O be/V able/G to/P travel/V ./O
But/C the/D day/N did/V not/A close/A so/A auspiciously/A as/P it/Q began/V ./O
--/O Towards/P the/D evening/N Marianne/R became/V ill/A again/A ,/O growing/V more/A heavy/G ,/O restless/G ,/O and/C uncomfortable/G than/P before/A ./O
Her/Q sister/N ,/O however/A ,/O still/A sanguine/G ,/O was/V willing/G to/P attribute/V the/D change/N to/P nothing/N more/G than/P the/D fatigue/N of/P having/V sat/V up/P to/P have/V her/Q bed/N made/V ;/O and/C carefully/A administering/V the/D cordials/N prescribed/V ,/O saw/V her/Q ,/O with/P satisfaction/N ,/O sink/N at/P last/G into/P a/D slumber/N ,/O from/P which/O she/Q expected/V the/D most/A beneficial/G effects/N ./O
Her/Q sleep/N ,/O though/P not/A so/A quiet/G as/P Elinor/R wished/V to/P see/V it/Q ,/O lasted/V a/D considerable/G time/N ;/O and/C anxious/G to/P observe/V the/D result/N of/P it/Q herself/Q ,/O she/Q resolved/V to/P sit/V with/P her/Q during/P the/D whole/G of/P it/Q ./O
Mrs./R Jennings/R ,/O knowing/V nothing/N of/P any/D change/N in/P the/D patient/N ,/O went/V unusually/A early/A to/P bed/N ;/O her/Q maid/N ,/O who/Q was/V one/O of/P the/D principal/G nurses/N ,/O was/V recreating/V herself/Q in/P the/D housekeeper/N 's/O room/N ,/O and/C Elinor/R remained/V alone/A with/P Marianne/R ./O
The/D repose/N of/P the/D latter/G became/V more/A and/C more/A disturbed/G ;/O and/C her/Q sister/N ,/O who/Q watched/V ,/O with/P unremitting/G attention/N her/Q continual/G change/N of/P posture/N ,/O and/C heard/V the/D frequent/G but/C inarticulate/G sounds/N of/P complaint/N which/O passed/V her/Q lips/N ,/O was/V almost/A wishing/V to/P rouse/V her/Q from/P so/A painful/G a/D slumber/N ,/O when/O Marianne/R ,/O suddenly/A awakened/V by/P some/D accidental/G noise/N in/P the/D house/N ,/O started/V hastily/A up/P ,/O and/C ,/O with/P feverish/G wildness/N ,/O cried/V out/O ,/O --/O ``/O Is/V mama/N coming/V ?/O

To/P consult/V with/P Colonel/R Brandon/R on/P the/D best/G means/N of/P effecting/V the/D latter/G ,/O was/V a/D thought/N which/O immediately/A followed/V the/D resolution/N of/P its/Q performance/N ;/O and/C as/A soon/A she/Q had/V rung/V up/O the/D maid/N to/P take/V her/Q place/N by/P her/Q sister/N ,/O she/Q hastened/V down/A to/P the/D drawing-room/N ,/O where/O she/Q knew/V he/Q was/V generally/A to/P be/V found/V at/P a/D much/A later/A hour/N than/P the/D present/G ./O

Elinor/R made/V no/D resistance/N that/O was/V not/A easily/A overcome/V ./O

His/Q opinion/N ,/O however/A ,/O made/V some/D little/G amends/N for/P his/Q delay/N ,/O for/P though/P acknowledging/V a/D very/A unexpected/G and/C unpleasant/G alteration/N in/P his/Q patient/N ,/O he/Q would/O not/A allow/V the/D danger/N to/P be/V material/G ,/O and/C talked/V of/P the/D relief/N which/O a/D fresh/G mode/N of/P treatment/N must/O procure/V ,/O with/P a/D confidence/N which/O ,/O in/P a/D lesser/G degree/N ,/O was/V communicated/V to/P Elinor/R ./O

The/D rapid/G decay/N ,/O the/D early/G death/N of/P a/D girl/N so/A young/G ,/O so/A lovely/G as/P Marianne/R ,/O must/O have/V struck/V a/D less/A interested/G person/N with/P concern/N ./O
On/P Mrs./R Jennings/R 's/O compassion/N she/Q had/V other/G claims/N ./O
She/Q had/V been/V for/P three/O months/N her/Q companion/N ,/O was/V still/A under/P her/Q care/N ,/O and/C she/Q was/V known/V to/P have/V been/V greatly/A injured/V ,/O and/C long/G unhappy/G ./O
The/D distress/N of/P her/Q sister/N too/A ,/O particularly/A a/D favourite/G ,/O was/V before/P her/Q ;/O --/O and/C as/A for/P their/Q mother/N ,/O when/O Mrs./R Jennings/R considered/V that/P Marianne/R might/O probably/A be/V to/P HER/V what/Q Charlotte/R was/V to/P herself/Q ,/O her/Q sympathy/N in/P HER/R sufferings/N was/V very/A sincere/G ./O
Mr./R Harris/R was/V punctual/G in/P his/Q second/G visit/N ;/O --/O but/C he/Q came/V to/P be/V disappointed/V in/P his/Q hopes/N of/P what/Q the/D last/G would/O produce/V ./O

Elinor/R ,/O catching/V all/D ,/O and/C more/A than/P all/D ,/O his/Q fears/N in/P a/D moment/N ,/O proposed/V to/P call/V in/P further/G advice/N ./O

She/Q was/V calm/G ,/O except/P when/O she/Q thought/V of/P her/Q mother/N ;/O but/C she/Q was/V almost/A hopeless/G ;/O and/C in/P this/D state/N she/Q continued/V till/P noon/N ,/O scarcely/A stirring/V from/P her/Q sister/N 's/O bed/N ,/O her/Q thoughts/N wandering/V from/P one/O image/N of/P grief/N ,/O one/O suffering/N friend/N to/P another/D ,/O and/C her/Q spirits/N oppressed/V to/P the/D utmost/N by/P the/D conversation/N of/P Mrs./R Jennings/R ,/O who/Q scrupled/V not/A to/P attribute/V the/D severity/N and/C danger/N of/P this/D attack/N to/P the/D many/G weeks/N of/P previous/G indisposition/N which/O Marianne/R 's/O disappointment/N had/V brought/V on/O ./O
Elinor/R felt/V all/D the/D reasonableness/N of/P the/D idea/N ,/O and/C it/Q gave/V fresh/G misery/N to/P her/Q reflections/N ./O
About/P noon/N ,/O however/A ,/O she/Q began/V --/O but/C with/P a/D caution/N --/O a/D dread/N of/P disappointment/N which/O for/P some/D time/N kept/V her/Q silent/G ,/O even/A to/P her/Q friend/N --/O to/P fancy/G ,/O to/P hope/V she/Q could/O perceive/V a/D slight/G amendment/N in/P her/Q sister/N 's/O pulse/N ;/O --/O she/Q waited/V ,/O watched/V ,/O and/C examined/V it/Q again/A and/C again/A ;/O --/O and/C at/P last/G ,/O with/P an/D agitation/N more/A difficult/G to/P bury/V under/P exterior/G calmness/N ,/O than/P all/D her/Q foregoing/N distress/N ,/O ventured/V to/P communicate/V her/Q hopes/N ./O
Mrs./R Jennings/R ,/O though/A forced/V ,/O on/P examination/N ,/O to/P acknowledge/V a/D temporary/G revival/N ,/O tried/V to/P keep/V her/Q young/G friend/N from/P indulging/V a/D thought/N of/P its/Q continuance/N ;/O --/O and/C Elinor/R ,/O conning/V over/P every/D injunction/N of/P distrust/G ,/O told/V herself/Q likewise/A not/A to/P hope/V ./O

Hope/R had/V already/A entered/V ;/O and/C feeling/V all/D its/Q anxious/G flutter/N ,/O she/Q bent/V over/P her/Q sister/N to/P watch/V --/O she/Q hardly/A knew/V for/P what/Q ./O
Half/D an/D hour/N passed/V away/A ,/O and/C the/D favourable/G symptom/N yet/A blessed/V her/Q ./O

Her/Q breath/N ,/O her/Q skin/N ,/O her/Q lips/N ,/O all/D flattered/G Elinor/G with/P signs/N of/P amendment/N ;/O and/C Marianne/R fixed/V her/Q eyes/N on/P her/Q with/P a/D rational/G ,/O though/P languid/N ,/O gaze/N ./O
Anxiety/R and/C hope/V now/A oppressed/V her/Q in/O equal/G degrees/N ,/O and/C left/V her/Q no/D moment/N of/P tranquillity/N till/P the/D arrival/N of/P Mr./R Harris/R at/P four/O o'/G clock/N ;/O --/O when/O his/Q assurances/N ,/O his/Q felicitations/N on/P a/D recovery/N in/P her/Q sister/N even/A surpassing/V his/Q expectation/N ,/O gave/V her/Q confidence/N ,/O comfort/N ,/O and/C tears/N of/P joy/N ./O
Marianne/R was/V in/P every/D respect/N materially/A better/A ,/O and/C he/Q declared/V her/Q entirely/A out/P of/P danger/N ./O
Mrs./R Jennings/R ,/O perhaps/A satisfied/V with/P the/D partial/G justification/N of/P her/Q forebodings/N which/O had/V been/V found/V in/P their/Q late/G alarm/N ,/O allowed/V herself/Q to/P trust/V in/P his/Q judgment/N ,/O and/C admitted/V ,/O with/P unfeigned/G joy/N ,/O and/C soon/A with/P unequivocal/G cheerfulness/N ,/O the/D probability/N of/P an/D entire/G recovery/N ./O

Her/Q joy/N was/V of/P a/D different/G kind/N ,/O and/C led/V to/P any/D thing/N rather/A than/P to/P gaiety/N ./O
Marianne/R restored/V to/P life/N ,/O health/N ,/O friends/N ,/O and/C to/P her/Q doting/N mother/N ,/O was/V an/D idea/N to/P fill/V her/Q heart/N with/P sensations/N of/P exquisite/N comfort/N ,/O and/C expand/V it/Q in/P fervent/N gratitude/N ;/O --/O but/C it/Q lead/N to/P no/D outward/G demonstrations/N of/P joy/N ,/O no/D words/N ,/O no/D smiles/N ./O
All/D within/P Elinor/R 's/O breast/N was/V satisfaction/N ,/O silent/G and/C strong/G ./O

The/D possibility/N of/P a/D relapse/N would/O of/P course/N ,/O in/P some/D moments/N ,/O occur/V to/P remind/V her/Q of/P what/Q anxiety/N was/V --/O but/C when/O she/Q saw/V ,/O on/P her/Q frequent/G and/C minute/G examination/N ,/O that/P every/D symptom/N of/P recovery/N continued/V ,/O and/C saw/V Marianne/R at/P six/O o'/N clock/N sink/N into/P a/D quiet/G ,/O steady/G ,/O and/C to/P all/D appearance/N comfortable/G ,/O sleep/V ,/O she/Q silenced/V every/D doubt/N ./O
