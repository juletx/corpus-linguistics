Vanity/R was/V the/D beginning/N and/C the/D end/N of/P Sir/R Walter/R Elliot/R 's/O character/N ;/O vanity/N of/P person/N and/C of/P situation/N ./O
He/Q had/V been/V remarkably/A handsome/G in/P his/Q youth/N ;/O and/C ,/O at/P fifty-four/A ,/O was/V still/A a/D very/A fine/G man/N ./O

He/Q considered/V the/D blessing/N of/P beauty/N as/P inferior/G only/A to/P the/D blessing/N of/P a/D baronetcy/N ;/O and/C the/D Sir/R Walter/R Elliot/R ,/O who/Q united/V these/D gifts/N ,/O was/V the/D constant/G object/N of/P his/Q warmest/N respect/N and/C devotion/N ./O
His/Q good/G looks/N and/C his/Q rank/N had/V one/O fair/G claim/N on/P his/Q attachment/N ;/O since/P to/P them/Q he/Q must/O have/V owed/V a/D wife/N of/P very/A superior/G character/N to/P any/D thing/N deserved/V by/P his/Q own/G ./O
Lady/R Elliot/R had/V been/V an/D excellent/G woman/N ,/O sensible/G and/C amiable/G ;/O whose/Q judgement/N and/C conduct/N ,/O if/P they/Q might/O be/V pardoned/V the/D youthful/G infatuation/N which/O made/V her/Q Lady/R Elliot/R ,/O had/V never/A required/V indulgence/N afterwards/A ./O
--/O She/Q had/V humoured/G ,/O or/C softened/V ,/O or/C concealed/V his/Q failings/N ,/O and/C promoted/V his/Q real/G respectability/N for/P seventeen/O years/N ;/O and/C though/P not/A the/D very/G happiest/G being/V in/P the/D world/N herself/Q ,/O had/V found/V enough/A in/P her/Q duties/N ,/O her/Q friends/N ,/O and/C her/Q children/N ,/O to/P attach/V her/Q to/P life/N ,/O and/C make/V it/Q no/D matter/N of/P indifference/N to/P her/Q when/O she/Q was/V called/V on/P to/P quit/V them/Q ./O

This/D friend/N ,/O and/C Sir/R Walter/R ,/O did/V not/A marry/V ,/O whatever/O might/O have/V been/V anticipated/V on/P that/D head/N by/P their/Q acquaintance/N ./O
Thirteen/O years/N had/V passed/V away/A since/P Lady/R Elliot/R 's/O death/N ,/O and/C they/Q were/V still/A near/P neighbours/N and/C intimate/G friends/N ,/O and/C one/O remained/V a/D widower/N ,/O the/D other/G a/D widow/N ./O
That/D Lady/R Russell/R ,/O of/P steady/G age/N and/C character/N ,/O and/C extremely/A well/A provided/V for/P ,/O should/O have/V no/D thought/N of/P a/D second/G marriage/N ,/O needs/V no/D apology/N to/P the/D public/N ,/O which/O is/V rather/A apt/G to/P be/V unreasonably/A discontented/V when/O a/D woman/N does/V marry/V again/A ,/O than/P when/O she/Q does/V not/A ;/O but/C Sir/R Walter/R 's/O continuing/V in/P singleness/N requires/V explanation/N ./O
Be/V it/Q known/V then/A ,/O that/P Sir/R Walter/R ,/O like/P a/D good/G father/N ,/O (/O having/V met/V with/P one/O or/C two/O private/G disappointments/N in/P very/A unreasonable/G applications/N )/O ,/O prided/V himself/Q on/P remaining/V single/G for/P his/Q dear/G daughters/N '/O sake/N ./O
For/P one/O daughter/N ,/O his/Q eldest/G ,/O he/Q would/O really/A have/V given/V up/O any/D thing/N ,/O which/O he/Q had/V not/A been/V very/A much/A tempted/V to/P do./R ./O
Elizabeth/R had/V succeeded/V ,/O at/P sixteen/O ,/O to/P all/D that/O was/V possible/G ,/O of/P her/Q mother/N 's/O rights/N and/C consequence/N ;/O and/C being/V very/A handsome/G ,/O and/C very/A like/P himself/Q ,/O her/Q influence/N had/V always/A been/V great/G ,/O and/C they/Q had/V gone/V on/P together/A most/G happily/A ./O
His/Q two/O other/G children/N were/V of/P very/A inferior/G value/N ./O
Mary/R had/V acquired/V a/D little/G artificial/G importance/N ,/O by/P becoming/V Mrs/R Charles/R Musgrove/R ;/O but/C Anne/R ,/O with/P an/D elegance/N of/P mind/N and/C sweetness/N of/P character/N ,/O which/O must/O have/V placed/V her/Q high/G with/P any/D people/N of/P real/G understanding/N ,/O was/V nobody/N with/P either/D father/N or/C sister/N ;/O her/Q word/N had/V no/D weight/N ,/O her/Q convenience/N was/V always/A to/P give/V way/N --/O she/Q was/V only/A Anne/V ./O
To/P Lady/R Russell/R ,/O indeed/A ,/O she/Q was/V a/D most/A dear/G and/C highly/A valued/V god-daughter/N ,/O favourite/G ,/O and/C friend/N ./O
Lady/R Russell/R loved/V them/Q all/D ;/O but/C it/Q was/V only/A in/P Anne/R that/P she/Q could/O fancy/V the/D mother/N to/P revive/V again/A ./O
A/D few/G years/N before/P ,/O Anne/R Elliot/R had/V been/V a/D very/A pretty/G girl/N ,/O but/C her/Q bloom/N had/V vanished/V early/A ;/O and/C as/A even/A in/P its/Q height/N ,/O her/Q father/N had/V found/V little/G to/P admire/V in/P her/Q ,/O (/O so/A totally/A different/G were/V her/Q delicate/G features/N and/C mild/G dark/G eyes/N from/P his/Q own/G )/O ,/O there/O could/O be/V nothing/N in/P them/Q ,/O now/A that/P she/Q was/V faded/V and/C thin/G ,/O to/P excite/V his/Q esteem/N ./O
He/Q had/V never/A indulged/V much/G hope/N ,/O he/Q had/V now/A none/N ,/O of/P ever/A reading/V her/Q name/N in/P any/D other/G page/N of/P his/Q favourite/G work/N ./O
All/D equality/N of/P alliance/N must/O rest/V with/P Elizabeth/R ,/O for/P Mary/R had/V merely/A connected/V herself/Q with/P an/D old/G country/N family/N of/P respectability/N and/C large/G fortune/N ,/O and/C had/V therefore/A given/V all/D the/D honour/N and/C received/V none/N :/O Elizabeth/R would/O ,/O one/O day/N or/C other/G ,/O marry/V suitably/A ./O
It/Q sometimes/A happens/V that/P a/D woman/N is/V handsomer/N at/P twenty-nine/O than/P she/Q was/V ten/O years/N before/P ;/O and/C ,/O generally/A speaking/N ,/O if/P there/O has/V been/V neither/D ill/G health/N nor/C anxiety/N ,/O it/Q is/V a/D time/N of/P life/N at/P which/O scarcely/A any/D charm/N is/V lost/V ./O
It/Q was/V so/A with/P Elizabeth/R ,/O still/A the/D same/G handsome/G Miss/R Elliot/R that/P she/Q had/V begun/V to/P be/V thirteen/O years/N ago/A ,/O and/C Sir/R Walter/R might/O be/V excused/V ,/O therefore/A ,/O in/P forgetting/V her/Q age/N ,/O or/C ,/O at/P least/G ,/O be/V deemed/V only/A half/D a/D fool/N ,/O for/P thinking/V himself/Q and/C Elizabeth/R as/P blooming/V as/P ever/A ,/O amidst/P the/D wreck/N of/P the/D good/G looks/N of/P everybody/N else/A ;/O for/P he/Q could/O plainly/A see/V how/O old/G all/D the/D rest/N of/P his/Q family/N and/C acquaintance/N were/V growing/V ./O
Anne/R haggard/R ,/O Mary/R coarse/G ,/O every/D face/N in/P the/D neighbourhood/N worsting/V ,/O and/C the/D rapid/G increase/N of/P the/D crow/N 's/O foot/N about/P Lady/R Russell/R 's/O temples/N had/V long/A been/V a/D distress/N to/P him/Q ./O
Elizabeth/R did/V not/A quite/A equal/V her/Q father/N in/P personal/G contentment/N ./O
Thirteen/O years/N had/V seen/V her/Q mistress/N of/P Kellynch/R Hall/R ,/O presiding/N and/C directing/N with/P a/D self-possession/N and/C decision/N which/O could/O never/A have/V given/V the/D idea/N of/P her/Q being/V younger/G than/P she/Q was/V ./O
For/P thirteen/O years/N had/V she/Q been/V doing/V the/D honours/N ,/O and/C laying/V down/O the/D domestic/G law/N at/P home/N ,/O and/C leading/V the/D way/N to/P the/D chaise/N and/C four/O ,/O and/C walking/V immediately/A after/P Lady/R Russell/R out/P of/P all/D the/D drawing-rooms/N and/C dining-rooms/N in/P the/D country/N ./O
Thirteen/O winters/N '/O revolving/G frosts/N had/V seen/V her/Q opening/V every/D ball/N of/P credit/N which/O a/D scanty/N neighbourhood/N afforded/V ,/O and/C thirteen/O springs/N shewn/P their/Q blossoms/N ,/O as/P she/Q travelled/V up/O to/P London/R with/P her/Q father/N ,/O for/P a/D few/G weeks/N '/O annual/G enjoyment/N of/P the/D great/G world/N ./O
She/Q had/V the/D remembrance/N of/P all/D this/D ,/O she/Q had/V the/D consciousness/N of/P being/V nine-and-twenty/G to/P give/V her/Q some/D regrets/N and/C some/D apprehensions/N ;/O she/Q was/V fully/A satisfied/G of/P being/V still/A quite/A as/A handsome/G as/P ever/A ,/O but/C she/Q felt/V her/Q approach/N to/P the/D years/N of/P danger/N ,/O and/C would/O have/V rejoiced/V to/P be/V certain/G of/P being/V properly/A solicited/V by/P baronet-blood/N within/P the/D next/G twelvemonth/N or/C two/O ./O
Then/A might/O she/Q again/A take/V up/O the/D book/N of/P books/N with/P as/A much/G enjoyment/N as/P in/P her/Q early/G youth/N ,/O but/C now/A she/Q liked/V it/Q not/A ./O
Always/A to/P be/V presented/V with/P the/D date/N of/P her/Q own/G birth/N and/C see/V no/D marriage/N follow/V but/C that/P of/P a/D youngest/G sister/N ,/O made/V the/D book/N an/D evil/G ;/O and/C more/A than/P once/A ,/O when/O her/Q father/N had/V left/V it/Q open/G on/P the/D table/N near/P her/Q ,/O had/V she/Q closed/V it/Q ,/O with/P averted/G eyes/N ,/O and/C pushed/V it/Q away/A ./O
She/Q had/V had/V a/D disappointment/N ,/O moreover/A ,/O which/O that/P book/N ,/O and/C especially/A the/D history/N of/P her/Q own/G family/N ,/O must/O ever/A present/V the/D remembrance/N of/P ./O
The/D heir/N presumptive/G ,/O the/D very/A William/R Walter/R Elliot/R ,/O Esq./R ,/O whose/Q rights/N had/V been/V so/A generously/A supported/V by/P her/Q father/N ,/O had/V disappointed/V her/Q ./O
She/Q had/V ,/O while/P a/D very/A young/G girl/N ,/O as/A soon/A as/P she/Q had/V known/V him/Q to/P be/V ,/O in/P the/D event/N of/P her/Q having/V no/D brother/N ,/O the/D future/N baronet/N ,/O meant/V to/P marry/V him/Q ,/O and/C her/Q father/N had/V always/A meant/V that/P she/Q should/O ./O
He/Q had/V not/A been/V known/V to/P them/Q as/P a/D boy/N ;/O but/C soon/A after/P Lady/R Elliot/R 's/O death/N ,/O Sir/R Walter/R had/V sought/V the/D acquaintance/N ,/O and/C though/P his/Q overtures/N had/V not/A been/V met/V with/P any/D warmth/N ,/O he/Q had/V persevered/V in/P seeking/V it/Q ,/O making/V allowance/N for/P the/D modest/G drawing-back/N of/P youth/N ;/O and/C ,/O in/P one/O of/P their/Q spring/N excursions/N to/P London/R ,/O when/O Elizabeth/R was/V in/P her/Q first/G bloom/N ,/O Mr/R Elliot/R had/V been/V forced/V into/P the/D introduction/N ./O
He/Q was/V at/P that/D time/N a/D very/A young/G man/N ,/O just/A engaged/V in/P the/D study/N of/P the/D law/N ;/O and/C Elizabeth/R found/V him/Q extremely/A agreeable/G ,/O and/C every/D plan/N in/P his/Q favour/N was/V confirmed/V ./O
He/Q was/V invited/V to/P Kellynch/R Hall/R ;/O he/Q was/V talked/V of/P and/C expected/V all/D the/D rest/N of/P the/D year/N ;/O but/C he/Q never/A came/V ./O
The/D following/V spring/N he/Q was/V seen/V again/A in/P town/N ,/O found/V equally/A agreeable/G ,/O again/A encouraged/V ,/O invited/V ,/O and/C expected/V ,/O and/C again/A he/Q did/V not/A come/V ;/O and/C the/D next/G tidings/N were/V that/P he/Q was/V married/V ./O
Instead/A of/P pushing/V his/Q fortune/N in/P the/D line/N marked/V out/O for/P the/D heir/N of/P the/D house/N of/P Elliot/R ,/O he/Q had/V purchased/V independence/N by/P uniting/V himself/Q to/P a/D rich/G woman/N of/P inferior/G birth/N ./O
Sir/R Walter/R has/V resented/V it/Q ./O
As/P the/D head/N of/P the/D house/N ,/O he/Q felt/V that/P he/Q ought/O to/P have/V been/V consulted/V ,/O especially/A after/P taking/V the/D young/G man/N so/A publicly/A by/P the/D hand/N ;/O ``/O For/P they/Q must/O have/V been/V seen/V together/A ,/O ''/O he/Q observed/V ,/O ``/O once/A at/P Tattersall/R 's/O ,/O and/C twice/A in/P the/D lobby/N of/P the/D House/R of/P Commons/R ./O ''/O
His/Q disapprobation/N was/V expressed/V ,/O but/C apparently/A very/A little/G regarded/V ./O
Mr/R Elliot/R had/V attempted/V no/D apology/N ,/O and/C shewn/A himself/Q as/P unsolicitous/G of/P being/V longer/A noticed/V by/P the/D family/N ,/O as/P Sir/R Walter/R considered/V him/Q unworthy/G of/P it/Q :/O all/D acquaintance/N between/P them/Q had/V ceased/V ./O
This/D very/A awkward/G history/N of/P Mr/R Elliot/R was/V still/A ,/O after/P an/D interval/N of/P several/G years/N ,/O felt/V with/P anger/N by/P Elizabeth/R ,/O who/Q had/V liked/V the/D man/N for/P himself/Q ,/O and/C still/A more/A for/P being/V her/Q father/N 's/O heir/N ,/O and/C whose/Q strong/G family/N pride/N could/O see/V only/A in/P him/Q a/D proper/G match/N for/P Sir/R Walter/R Elliot/R 's/O eldest/G daughter/N ./O
There/O was/V not/A a/D baronet/N from/P A/N to/P Z/N whom/Q her/Q feelings/N could/O have/V so/A willingly/A acknowledged/V as/P an/D equal/G ./O
Yet/A so/A miserably/A had/V he/Q conducted/V himself/Q ,/O that/P though/P she/Q was/V at/P this/D present/G time/N (/O the/D summer/N of/P 1814/O )/O wearing/V black/G ribbons/N for/P his/Q wife/N ,/O she/Q could/O not/A admit/V him/Q to/P be/V worth/G thinking/N of/P again/A ./O
The/D disgrace/N of/P his/Q first/G marriage/N might/O ,/O perhaps/A ,/O as/P there/O was/V no/D reason/N to/P suppose/V it/Q perpetuated/V by/P offspring/N ,/O have/V been/V got/V over/P ,/O had/V he/Q not/A done/V worse/G ;/O but/C he/Q had/V ,/O as/P by/P the/D accustomary/G intervention/N of/P kind/N friends/N ,/O they/Q had/V been/V informed/V ,/O spoken/V most/G disrespectfully/A of/P them/Q all/D ,/O most/A slightingly/A and/C contemptuously/A of/P the/D very/G blood/N he/Q belonged/V to/P ,/O and/C the/D honours/N which/O were/V hereafter/A to/P be/V his/Q own/G ./O
This/D could/O not/A be/V pardoned/V ./O
Such/G were/V Elizabeth/R Elliot/R 's/O sentiments/N and/C sensations/N ;/O such/G the/D cares/N to/P alloy/V ,/O the/D agitations/N to/P vary/V ,/O the/D sameness/N and/C the/D elegance/N ,/O the/D prosperity/N and/C the/D nothingness/N of/P her/Q scene/N of/P life/N ;/O such/G the/D feelings/N to/P give/V interest/N to/P a/D long/G ,/O uneventful/G residence/N in/P one/O country/N circle/N ,/O to/P fill/V the/D vacancies/N which/O there/O were/V no/D habits/N of/P utility/N abroad/A ,/O no/D talents/N or/C accomplishments/N for/P home/N ,/O to/P occupy/V ./O

Their/Q minds/N most/A dissimilar/G !/O
Where/O could/O have/V been/V the/D attraction/N ?/O
The/D answer/N soon/A presented/V itself/Q ./O
It/Q had/V been/V in/P situation/N ./O
They/Q had/V been/V thrown/V together/A several/G weeks/N ;/O they/Q had/V been/V living/V in/P the/D same/G small/G family/N party/N :/O since/P Henrietta/R 's/O coming/V away/A ,/O they/Q must/O have/V been/V depending/V almost/A entirely/A on/P each/D other/G ,/O and/C Louisa/R ,/O just/A recovering/V from/P illness/N ,/O had/V been/V in/P an/D interesting/G state/N ,/O and/C Captain/R Benwick/R was/V not/A inconsolable/G ./O

She/Q did/V not/A mean/V ,/O however/A ,/O to/P derive/V much/A more/A from/P it/Q to/P gratify/V her/Q vanity/N ,/O than/P Mary/R might/O have/V allowed/V ./O
She/Q was/V persuaded/V that/P any/D tolerably/A pleasing/V young/G woman/N who/Q had/V listened/V and/C seemed/V to/P feel/V for/P him/Q would/O have/V received/V the/D same/G compliment/N ./O
He/Q had/V an/D affectionate/G heart/N ./O
He/Q must/O love/V somebody/N ./O

Louisa/R had/V fine/G naval/G fervour/N to/P begin/V with/P ,/O and/C they/Q would/O soon/A grow/V more/A alike/A ./O
He/Q would/O gain/V cheerfulness/N ,/O and/C she/Q would/O learn/V to/P be/V an/D enthusiast/N for/P Scott/R and/C Lord/R Byron/R ;/O nay/R ,/O that/O was/V probably/A learnt/G already/A ;/O of/P course/N they/Q had/V fallen/V in/P love/N over/P poetry/N ./O
The/D idea/N of/P Louisa/R Musgrove/R turned/V into/P a/D person/N of/P literary/G taste/N ,/O and/C sentimental/G reflection/N was/V amusing/G ,/O but/C she/Q had/V no/D doubt/N of/P its/Q being/V so./N ./O
The/D day/N at/P Lyme/R ,/O the/D fall/N from/P the/D Cobb/R ,/O might/O influence/V her/Q health/N ,/O her/Q nerves/N ,/O her/Q courage/N ,/O her/Q character/N to/P the/D end/N of/P her/Q life/N ,/O as/P thoroughly/A as/P it/Q appeared/V to/P have/V influenced/V her/Q fate/N ./O
