Thirty-three Scotty did not go back to school His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off spend a lot of time in bed and for the rest do pretty much as he chose provided of course he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home there was little danger of his losing a term
Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments
He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a celebration lunch at the cafeteria on the campus Rachel wore a smart hat and because she had been warned recently about smoking puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick Scotty's father sat sprawled in his chair angular alert as a cricket looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship
Teachers men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel Rachel was polite Scotty indifferent They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food the teachers the heroic baronial windows and the bright ranks of college banners His father tried to make the food a topic
The blueberry pie is good Scotty I recommend it He looked at his son his face worried Scotty murmured No thanks so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest He said more loudly full old Pop He had eaten almost nothing on the crested three-sectioned plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container
all right Craig Rachel said I can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home
Since his seizure Scotty had had little appetite yet his changed appearance surprisingly was one of plumpness His face was fuller his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking He breathed now with his mouth open showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth he kept his eyes with their puffed blurred lids always lowered though not apparently focusing Even his neck seemed thicker and therefore shorter His hands which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds were now neither active nor really relaxed They lay on his lap palms up stiffly motionless the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints Altogether he had since the seizure the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise He looked lazy spoiled a little querulous
Rachel had little to say She greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness offering nothing Mr. McKinley for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity was completely alert to his son eyes always on the still face jumping to anticipate Scotty's desires It was a strained silent lunch
Rachel said better get him to bed
The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger
Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth They did not speak much Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly Look at those stupid kids It was a Negro section of peeling row houses store-front churches and ragged children Rachel had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat He said Nothing And then There are lots of kids around here
Scotty looked at the children his mouth slightly opened his eyes dull He felt tired and full and calm
Thirty-four the days seemed short perhaps because his routine was each day almost the same He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel Virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food biscuits cookies candies the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen She would hover over him and looking like her brother anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or spoon
You eat enough honey Try to get that down
Rachel observing would say He has to rediscover his own capacity take time
Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere Both watched Scotty constantly Rachel without seeming to Virginia openly her eyes filled with concern Scotty was neutral He did not resent their supervision or Virginia's sometimes tiring sympathy He ate what he felt like slept as much or as little as he pleased and moved about the draughty rooms of the house when he was not in bed with slow dubious steps like an elderly tourist in a cathedral His energy was gone He was able now to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving His hands lay loosely yet stiffly they were like wax hands almost lifelike not quite folded in his lap his mouth hung slightly open When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable he would answer if as often happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only a little louder
He had not mentioned Kate He had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly almost accidentally encounter her At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest but it was an objective pain in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed it was merely another part of his weakness He was calm drugged and lazy He did not care
Rachel mentioned Kate She said I notice the girl from across the street bothered to phone or visit
Scotty said all right all right He thought about it briefly then deliberately turned the talk to something else
Once sitting at the front window in his parents' room he saw Kate come out of her house She was with Elizabeth They were far off and looked tiny The heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them They turned at the bottom of Kate's steps and moved off in the direction of the park He thought he saw it awakened and for a moment interested him that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate
The doctor since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him came often and informally to the house He would sit slim-waisted and spare on the edge of Scotty's bed his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor Scotty did not mind the doctor's unsmiling teasing as he used to
Husky young man he said with mock distaste I imagine always battling in school
I go to school any more
Pardon The doctor had to bend close to hear his delicate hand as veined as a moth's wing rested absently on Scotty's chest Scotty said the same words more loudly Oh Well taking a little vacation all He turned unsmilingly to Rachel I think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little He could now but the weakness is very definite it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily be stronger soon His stethoscope was on the table by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at Scotty He said fussily Just keep the cap on those strong emotions The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room drop by again in a few days
Rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone She smoothed the covers on Scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor She did not touch him Scotty watched with disinterest He did not speak He had no desire to
She said Do you think miss school
He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown He did not care He felt her irritability did not concern him yet he knew he would not care even if it did He shook his head
had any number of calls about you You could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble Miss Estherson called twice She wants to pay you a visit She says the children miss you Apparently you were the light of their lives
Scotty shrugged slightly Rachel came close to the bed bent as if she would kiss him then moved away She was frowning That doctor annoys me She seemed to speak to herself Do you suppose his self-consciousness is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors in general
She turned to him again Well Mrs. Charles Sally has phoned too She was very worried Rachel's tone was dry She really say She glanced away at the floor then swooped gracefully and picked up one of Scotty's slippers I mean do you feel like seeing Kate
Scotty said I know It was true He did not There was the slight pain but it was no different from the throbbing in his head
Well time in any case wait till stronger and then talk about it She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed
Scotty said Okay
This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead Scotty was pleased
His father was a constant visitor Scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice it floated up the stairs
Scotty
And Rachel's or Virginia's reply better getting plenty of rest
Is his appetite improved Or Does he get exercise
The exchange was almost invariable and Scotty in his bed could hear every word of it He never smiled It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son After a pause during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs
Scotty would reply softly and his father apologetically would ask him to repeat
eating more he would say Or I walk around the house a lot
Perhaps you should get out a little
not supposed to yet He was not irritated He did not mind the useless kindly questions He looked at the lined face with vague interest he felt he was noting it as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger
Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care seeking something material to blame for his son's illness
Have you got enough blankets And another time without accusation You never wore that scarf I bought you

Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion Papa-san sat glacier-like his smooth solidity his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him Our objective the colonel had said that day of the briefing is Papa-san There the objective sat brooding over all Gouge burn blast insult it as they would could anyone really take Papa-san
Between the ponderous hulk and himself in the valley over which Papa-san reigned men had hidden high explosives booby traps and mines The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion On the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire At the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye range like a wild tangle of children's hoops stopped simultaneously weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling again Closer still regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports Was it all vain labor Who would clean up the mess when the war was over Smiling at his quixotic thoughts Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down Tonight a group of men tomorrow night he himself would go out there somewhere and wait If he were to go with White he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san but moving ever deeper into enemy land behind Papa-san itself Was this what he had expected He realized that there would be so much time to think so many lulls Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told that combat was an intermittent activity Now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached It could take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now There was just too much time Time to become afraid White's suggestion flattered but he did not like the identity He did not spill over with hatred for the enemy He even seen him yet
Pressing his cigarette out in the earth Warren walked to the slit and scanned the jagged hills He saw no life but still stood there for a time peering at the unlovely hills his gaze continually returning to Papa-san He had come here in order to test himself While most of his beliefs were still unsettled he knew that he did not believe in killing Yet he was here He had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a coward
There were ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night The beaming ROK was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun another man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition Warren and White each carried in addition to their own weapons and ammo a box of ammo for the ROK's machine gun Others carried extra clips for the Browning Automatic Rifle which was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon We just sit quiet and wait Prevot had said Be sure the man nearest you is awake If Joe show up all be back here at 0600 hours Otherwise we hold a reception Then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover but nobody pulls out until I say so Remember what I said about going out to get anybody left behind That still holds We bring back all dead and wounded
At 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure Then began the journey through their own mine fields Mines Ours were kinder than theirs some said They set bouncing betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully had them go off at the head Mines Big ones and little The crude wooden boxes of the enemy our nicely turned gray metal disks But theirs defied the detectors Mines A foot misplaced a leg missing Mines All sizes big ones some wired to set off a whole field little ones hand grenade size Booby traps to fill the head with chunks of metal Warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by looking at the sky It was dark Prevot had said that the searchlights would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours which gives us time to get settled in position
Because they were new men and to be sure that they get lost Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out His eyes now fixed on White's solid figure Warren could hear behind him the tread of another He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position They were going to follow it for part of their journey safe Prevot had said and it provides cover for our noise
Soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night On their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees If a branch extended out too far each man held it back for the next and if they met a low overhang each warned the other Thus stealthily they advanced upstream then they turned to the right climbed the embankment and walked into the valley again There was no cover here only grass sighing against pant-legs And with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert the grass stripped something from Warren The gentle whir of each footstep left him more naked than before until he felt his unprotected flesh tremble chilled by each new sound The shapes of the men ahead of him lacked solidity as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords The warped broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes Clumps of brush that they passed were so many enchained demons straining in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones Looming over all Papa-san leered down at him threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies Off in the distance a searchlight flashed on its beam slashing the sky The sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud then reflected to the earth in a softer diffused radiance Somewhere over there another patrol had need of light Warren thought of all the men out that night who like himself had left their protective ridge and fear working at their guts picked their way into the area beyond From the east to the west coast of the Korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts White's arm went up and Warren raised his own The patrol was stopping
Prevot came up Take that spot over there he whispered pointing to a small clump of blackness Give me your machine gun ammo Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line
Lying in the grass behind the brush clump Warren looked about The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes setting up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol
Warren eased his rifle's safety off and gently slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an Aj This he placed within quick reach The walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air Although the armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly he felt no security Figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched Certain this menace was only imaginary he yet stared in fascinated horror his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon He was aware of insistent inner beatings as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body
Above the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light Then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene Even so he could not ease the tension of his body the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax Sensing the unseen presence of the other men in the patrol he felt mutely united to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him He sensed something precious in the perilous moment something akin to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness
In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky and always as he wandered he felt a stranger to their exultation They were poems in a strange language of which he could barely touch a meaning enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there Brittany that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads had worked some subtle change in him he knew and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre
Pierre had no hands they had been severed at the wrists With leather cups fitted in his handlebars he steered his bicycle He and Warren had traveled together for four days They visited the shipyards at Brest and Pierre had to sign the register vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner He took the pen in his stumps and began to write
Wait Wait Cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside They crowded the small room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book
formidable they exclaimed
Mais oui merveilleux
And then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity
it ever bother you Warren had asked to have people always asking you about your hands
Oh the French are a very curious people Pierre had laughed They are also honest seekers after truth Now the English are painfully silent about my missing hands They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there The Americans like yourself take the fact for granted try to be helpful but ask questions used to all three but I think the French have the healthiest attitude
That was the day that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey of Solesmes You are looking tired and there you can rest It will be good for you I think too he said his dark eyes mischievous that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken
Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception I speak English the old man said but I do not hear it very well He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that might help Smiling at Warren's protestations the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor Will you please wait in here

Mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue Al's Little Cafe was small dark narrow and filled with the mingled scent of beer tobacco smoke and Italian cooking Hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke The nude was small and black-haired and elfin and was called Eloise
This was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers The reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway
His friend Jane was with him She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and own the mint She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury This meant sorting out press clippings and the like
Jane sat receptive and interested Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said You see both of them I mean the President and Jeff Lawrence are romantics A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has to do is find the right key and then divine justice and altruism will appear like focusing a camera the distant ship there until you get the focus You know what talking about sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them
But when it comes to war the Colonel knows what it is and Jeff Mr. Christiansen knows that a soldier will get the Distinguished Service Medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian He had a mean unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit and someone invented the name Trig for him to say he was trigger happy shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry He was a wiry inscrutable silent country boy from the red clay of rural Alabama and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally make fun of But not in front of Trig I heard of some that tried it back in the States and knock them clear across the room been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base A New York kid a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs made fun of Trig's accent and drew a knife Before the fight was over the Harlem boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly They caught Trig stealing liquor from the officers' mess and he got a couple of girls in trouble The fear of punishment just bother him It there It was left out of him at birth This is why he made such a magnificent soldier He troubled with the ordinary rank-and-file fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic It just occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him Do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was
Jane nodded with a pleasant smile
All right There was a sniper's nest in a mountain cave and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out and I suggested You ask for volunteers and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao Trig was one of the five volunteers The patrol snaked around in back of the cave approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls You could hear them from our outpost There was a lot of shooting We knew the enemy was subdued because a flare was fired as the signal So we hurried over Two of our men were killed a third was wounded Trig and a very black colored boy from Detroit had killed or put out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting When we got there Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded Filipino The colored boy had it and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said Give that to me you black bastard We 'low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where I come from
The Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound
What did the Colonel do about the men Jane asked in her placid interested way
Mickie laughed He recommended both of them for the DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple Heart too for a combat-inflicted wound So you see Mr. Christiansen knows what all about But not Jeff Lawrence When he was in the war he was in Law or Supplies or something like that and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations for medals just like the one we sent in for Trig and go away with a real glow These were heroes nine feet tall to him
Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river He had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with two heads Beside him was Mrs. Dalloway He thought how this dainty fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June enjoying the flowers in the shops the greetings from old friends but never really drawing a deep passionate breath was so like himself He and Mrs. Dalloway too had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the bone marrow of the spirit
He had not because he was both poor and ambitious Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious They stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane No they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the ladder He made the decision with his eyes open or so he thought At any cost he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania mining town where his father was a pharmacist And so he had so he had At State College he had no time to walk among the violets on the water's edge From his room he could look out in springtime and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly deliciously across the campus and he could smell the sweet vernal winds He was not stone He was not unmoved He had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him He must mentally pull the blinds and close the window so that all that existed was in the books before him At law school the same More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York By the time he was prosperous enough his goals were high he was bald and afraid of women The only one who would have him was his cripple the strange unhappy woman who became his wife Perhaps it was right perhaps it was just He had dared to defy nature to turn his back to the Lorelei and he was punished Like Mrs. Dalloway with her regrets about Peter Walsh he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent If he had had a son he would tell him Gather ye rosebuds while ye may This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying But then his son could afford it
Lawrence was waiting for Bill Boxell The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home He said the matter was urgent The Secretary was uneasy about the visit He did not like Boxell He suspected something underhanded and furtive about him Lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely and this worried him When you disliked or distrusted a man you should have a reason Human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell Lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear It did not Therefore he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view
A half hour later the Vice President arrived He looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind He observed the Florentine vase in the hall the Renoir painting in the library as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes the pattern of the Oriental rug the delicate cut-glass chandelier
He said to the Secretary I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre How did you find out about this He waved his arm around at the furnishings
It was not a discourteous question Lawrence decided This young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious he had to find out The Secretary did not tell him at what cost at what loneliness he learned these things He merely said Any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home
The Vice President said If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's home let me know I can do business with that kind
Again Lawrence thought a little sadly these were the fees of poverty and ambition Boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously He had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years
They had brandy in the library Boxell looked at Lawrence with a searching glance the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial What are your weaknesses Where will you break How best to destroy your peace
The Vice President said with a slight bluster There anyone who loves the President more than I do Old Chris is my ideal At the same time you have to face facts and realize that a man been in the Marine Corps all his life understand much about politics What does a monk know about sex
Lawrence listened with the practiced deceptive calm of the lawyer but his face was in the shadow
So we have to protect the old man for his own good You see what I mean Congress is full of politicians and if you want to get along with them you have to be politic This is why I say we just go ahead and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses Let me tell you what happened to me today A fellow came up to me a Senator I have to tell you his name and he told me I love the President like a brother but God damn it crucifying me got a quarter of a million Germans in my state and those krautheads tune in on Father Werther every night and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public square what they do telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament of Germany And another one comes to me and he says Look here a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy

The Bishop looked at him coldly and said Take it or leave it
Literally there was nothing else to do He was caught in a machine But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly go and see what like
Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River a small and dirty stream The city was a center of manufacture especially in textiles and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama But it had as was usual in southern cities of this sort a Black Bottom a low region near the river where the Negroes lived servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime
Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were Beyond were industries and factories Then they went down to Black Bottom In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church It was an old and dirty wooden structure sadly in need of repair But it was a landmark It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town black and white knew of it It had just suffered a calamity the final crisis in a long series of calamities For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead and the city mourned him
He was a loud-voiced man once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability He was stern and overbearing with his flock but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites especially the rich who partly supported the church The Deacon Board headed by a black man named Carlson had practically taken over as the pastor grew old and had its way with the support of the Amen corner The characteristic thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious orgy A knot of old worshippers chiefly women listened weekly to a sermon It began invariably in low tones almost conversational and then gradually worked up to high shrill appeals to God and man And then the Amen corner took hold re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus spreading down through the African forest overseas to the West Indies and then here in Alabama With shout and slow dance with tears and song with scream and contortion the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering wailing shouting possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week to week It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting
Wilson on his first Sunday witnessed this with something like disgust He had preached a short sermon trying to talk man-to-man to the audience to tell them who he was what he had done in Macon and Birmingham and what he proposed to do here He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor But then at mention of that name the Amen corner broke loose He had no chance to say another word At the very end when the audience was silent and breathless a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out The audience did not think much of the new pastor and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say
During the next weeks he looked over the situation First of all there was the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not repaired for years with no plumbing or sewage with rat-holes and rot It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church a woman named Catt who as Wilson afterward found was briefly referred to as The Cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative
Ann Catt was a lonely devoted soul never married conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church but a perpetual dissenter and born critic She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository
Then Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition The salary of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500 but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing The church itself must be repaired It was dirty and neglected It really ought to be rebuilt and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this Meanwhile the city itself should be talked to The streets in the colored section were dirty There was typhoid and malaria The children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalks The school was small dark and ill-equipped The teacher was a pliant fool There were two liquor saloons not very far from the church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes the other exclusively Negro Undoubtedly there was a good deal of gambling in both
On the other side of the church was a quiet well-kept house with shutters and recently painted Wilson inquired about it It was called Kent House The deacon of the church Carlson was its janitor One of the leading members of the Amen corner was cook there were two or three colored maids employed there Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people which seemed to him rather queer Why should a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom But nevertheless it looked respectable He was glad to have it there
The rest of Black Bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect disrepair and careful upkeep Dives carefully repaired huts and nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl with little distinction The best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better The yards front and back were narrow some were trash dumps some had flower gardens Behind were privies for there was no sewage system
After looking about a bit Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom across the river and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot He talked about it to the Presiding Elder The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand But there was one thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately In fact he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here to make a larger contribution of dollar money
Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a better church a more business-like conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization He emphasized to the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible But he told Wilson to go ahead and try And Wilson tried
It did seem impossible The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk When it was proposed to rebuild the church Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed
But when this proposal was made to his Deacon Board he met unanimous opposition The church certainly would not be removed The very proposition was sacrilege It had been here fifty years It was going to stay forever It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject As for rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no hurry at all
Wilson again went downtown to a different banker an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but he shook his head
Reverend he said I think you quite understand the situation here you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church Tenements stores saloons some gambling I hope not too much The colored people are getting employment at Kent House and other places and they are near their places of employment When a city has arranged things like this you easily change them Now if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years By that time perhaps something better can be done
Then Wilson asked What about this Kent House which you mention I understand why a white hotel should be down here
The young banker looked at him with a certain surprise and then he said flatly afraid I tell you anything in particular about Kent House have to find out about it on your own Hope to see you again And he dismissed the colored pastor
It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand She said My dear do you know what Kent House is
No said Wilson I I was just asking about it What is it
a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates They hire a good deal of local labor including two members of our Trustee Board They buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen in town
Wilson stared at her My dear you must be mistaken
Talk to Mrs. Catt she said
And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to others he was absolutely amazed This of course was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities putting white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly But it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages
But this situation of Kent House was more subtle The wages involved were larger and more regular The inmates were white and from out of town avoiding local friction The backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity Good wages patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go And for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist church if not in all churches

Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold There was a fog which increased the darkness of the night Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow He might have been anywhere or nowhere
The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi Secretary of State Seward was a sick man The idea had come from Herold who had once been a chemist's clerk The sick were always receiving medicines No one would question such an errand The bottle was filled up with flour
Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse Seward's home where Key had once been killed Now it would have another death From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry He clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell Like the bell at Mass the doorbell was pitched too high It was still Good Friday after all
A nigger boy opened the door Payne did not notice him He was thinking chiefly of Cap If their schedules were to synchronize there was no point in wasting time He pushed his way inside
For a moment the hall confused him This was the largest house he had ever been in almost the largest building except for a hotel He had no idea where Seward's room would be In the half darkness the banisters gleamed and the hall seemed enormous Above him somewhere were the bedrooms Seward would be up there
He explained his errand but without bothering much to make it plausible for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army He did not really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed even while you watched yourself giving way to it He was no longer worried Everything would be all right He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped
Still the sensation always surprised him It was a thrill he felt no part in He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick appalling and efficient things
He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs They were carpeted but made for pumps and congress gaiters not the great clodhoppers he wore The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum
At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown He stopped and whispered his errand Young Frederick Seward held out his hand Panting a little Payne shook his head Dr. Verdi had told him to deliver his package in person
Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping and then went through a pantomime at his father's door to prove the statement
Very well Payne said I will go He smiled but now that he knew where the elder Seward was he did not intend to go He pulled out his pistol and fired it It made no sound It had misfired Reversing it he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head over and over again
It was the first blow that was always difficult After that violence was exultantly easy He got caught up into it and became a different person Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless so that he would puzzle over it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real
The nigger boy fled down the stairs screaming Murder
It was not murder at all Payne was more methodical than that He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do
He ran for the sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away A knife would do From childhood he had known all about knives Someone blocked the door from inside He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness He saw only dimly moving figures but when he slashed them they yelled and fled He went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could repeatedly It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams
Two men pulled him off Nobody said anything Payne hacked at their arms There was a lady there in a nightdress He would not have wanted to hurt a lady Another man approached this one fully dressed When the knife went into his chest he went down at once
mad shouted Payne as he ran out into the hall mad and only wished he had been That would have made things so much easier But he was not mad He was only dreaming
He clattered down the stairs and out of the door Somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still yelling murder One always wakes up even from one's own dreams The clammy air revived him Herold he saw had fled
Well one did not expect much of people like Herold
He unhitched his horse walked it away mounted and spurred it on The nigger boy was close behind him Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone He rode on and on He had no idea where he was After some time he came to an open field An open field was better than a building that was for sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the grass
He felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away he knew he should get to Cap but he know how He was sure for he had done as he was told he Cap would find him and take care of him So choosing a good tree he clambered up into it found a comfortable notch and curled up in it to sleep like the tousled bear he was with his hands across his chest as though surfeited with honey
Violence always made him tired but he was not frightened
In Boston Edwin Booth was winding up a performance of A New Way To Pay Old Debts It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more Acting soothed him On a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge by the applause he must be doing it better than usual
As Sir Giles Overreach how often had he had to play that part who did not believe a word of it he raised his arm and declaimed Where is my honour now
That was one of the high spots of the play The audience as usual loved it He was delighted to see them so happy If he had any worries it was only the small ones about Mother in New York and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour with her Aunt Asia in Philadelphia
Everyone is ambivalent about his profession if he has practised it long enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there who might cheer you or boo you but that was largely though not entirely up to you
They made the world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not
7 Wilkes was quite right about one thing Laura Keene had been in the green room The commotion had brought her into the wings Since she could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water holding it up to the box high above her head to Miss Harris who had asked for it
She had been one of the first to collect her wits
It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience as that they had been stunned already Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before and unless Miss Keene was on stage there was not much to it The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom
The stage had been empty except for Harry Hawk doing his star monologue The audience was fond of Harry Hawk he was a dear in or out of character but he was not particularly funny At the end of the monologue the audience would applaud Meanwhile it looked at the scenery
Well I guess I know enough to turn you inside out you sockdologizing old mantrap Said Trenchard otherwise Hawk There was always a pause here before the next line
That was when the gun went off Yet even that explosion did not mean much Guns were going off all over Washington City these days because of the celebrations and the theatre was not soundproof
Then the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box Sic semper tyrannis it said mildly Booth had delivered his line Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke
They strained forward They had not heard what had been said They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily The figure leapt from the box almost lost its balance the flag draped there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell on its hands and pressed itself up
Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings His speech faltered He did not lower his arm
The figure was so theatrically dressed that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon This figure looked like the slave dealer from that But it also looked like a toad hopping away from the light There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them
Then it disappeared into the wings
Harry Hawk had not shifted position but he at last lowered his arm
Mrs. Lincoln screamed There was no mistaking that scream It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do Yet this scream had a different note in it That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water
Clara Harris one of the guests in the box stood up and demanded water Her action was involuntary When something unexpected happened one always asked for water if one were a woman brandy if one were a man
Mrs. Lincoln screamed again
In the Presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled He has shot the President
That got everybody up On the stage Harry Hawk began to weep Laura Keene brushed by him with the glass of water The crowd began to move In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of plots and one death might attract another It was not exactly panic they gave way to but they could not just sit there The beehive voices for no one could bear silence drowned out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln's weeping
At the rear of the auditorium upstairs some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor It would not give
A Dr. Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water
Someone opened the corridor door from the inside and called for a doctor Somehow Dr. Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor He went straight to the Presidential box
As usual Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head but nobody blamed her for doing so now There was a little blood on the hem of her dress for the assassin had slashed Miss Harris's companion Major Rathbone with a knife Rathbone said he was bleeding to death By the look of him he that far gone

With a sneer the man spread his legs and a third time confronted them
Once more Katie reared and whinnied in fear For a moment boy and mount hung in midair Stevie twisted and frantically commanded the mare to leap straight ahead But the stranger was nimbler still With a bold arm he dared once more to obstruct them Katie reared a third time then trembling descended
The stranger leered Seizing the bridle he tugged with all his might and forced Katie to her knees It was absurd Stevie could feel himself toppling He saw the ground coming up and the stranger's head With incredible ferocity he brought his fists together and struck The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone The man uttered a weird cry spun about and collapsed in the sand
Katie scrambled to her feet Stevie agilely retaining his seat Again Katie reared and now wickedly he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger He could feel his own feet iron-shod striking repeatedly until the body was limp He gloated and his lips slavered He heard himself chortling
They rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand Only the top of the head with a spot bare and white as a clamshell remained visible Stevie was shouting triumphantly
A train hooted Instantly he chilled They were pursuing him He was frightened his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt Then Katie stumbled and again he was falling falling
Stevie Stevie
His mother was nudging him but he was still falling His head hung over the boards of Katie's stall before it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger
Stevie wake up now nearly there
He had been dreaming He was safe in his Mama's arms
The train had slowed Houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot Po' Chavis The trainman called He came by and repeated Po' Chavis
Chapter 6 Bong Bong Startled him awake The room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it Bong A dull boom and a throbbing echo The walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled He stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon Bong He raced to the window and yanked at the sash Bong The wood was old the paint alligatored Bong A fresh breeze saluted him Six o'clock
He put his head out There was the slate roof of the church ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster The clock which had struck presented an innocent face
In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards
a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high And the loudest clock in the whole world
I know Stephen she smiled They say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high The clock you heard strike really the town clock was installed last April by Mrs. Shorter on her birthday
He dressed and sped outdoors He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square The steeple leaned backward while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long shapeless coat The spire seemed to hold up the sky
Port Jervis basking in the foothills was the city of God The Dutch Reformed Church with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street the Catholic Saint Mary's Church with an even taller steeple and a cross on top stood on Ball Street The Catholics had the largest cemetery near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds
God was everywhere in the belfry in the steeple in the clouds in the trees and in the mountains hulking on the horizon Somewhere beyond where shadows lurked must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and the dreadful Lake of Fire
So walking in awe he became familiar with God who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church with its high steeple and clock There was no church like Drew Church no preacher like Papa who was intimate with Him and could consign sinners to hellfire To know God he must follow in Papa's footsteps He was fortunate and proud
The veterans idling on their benches in the Square beneath the soldiers' monument got to their feet when Papa approached Morning Reverend His being and His will Stevie could not divide God from his Papa illumined every parish face turned the choir into a band of angels and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven
We have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge Mama announced and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars
When Papa went out to do God's work Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy which was drawn by Violet the new black mare Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal and northward to Brooklyn below Point Peter he could see the church spire wherever he looked back Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse Afternoon Reverend and crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras that was Pennsylvania
In the Delaware River three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush South of Laurel Grove Cemetery and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware was the Tri-State Rock from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well as New York simply by spinning around on his heel
On these excursions Papa instructed him on man's chief end which was his duty to God and his own salvation However a boy's lively eyes might rove Where Cuddleback Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming hole Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth Idle recreation Stevie saw no idols it troubled him that he always see what Papa saw He was torn between the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello Branch
Where you been today Ludie inquired every evening pretending that he did not care make a preacher out of you
No he Stevie flared Not me
got to be a preacher in the family He made a will and last testament before we left Paterson I heard them Uncle and Aunt Howe were the witnesses
Will he die
Everybody does
Ludie could be hateful To speak of Papa dying was a sin It could never happen as long as God was alert and the Drew steeple stood guard with its peaked lance
Stevie was constantly slipping into the church He pulled with all his strength at the heavy brass-bound door and shuffled along the wainscoted wall The cold mysterious presence of God was all around him At the end of a shaft of light the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon Far away standing before a curtained window in the study room was his father hands tucked under his coattails and staring into the dark church The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence
The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair Would Papa really die The mouth was thin-lipped and wide the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide When Papa's slender fingers removed the spectacles there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose
time you began to think on God Stephen Perhaps one day He will choose you as He chose me long ago Therefore give Him your affection and store up His love for you Open your heart to Him and pray Stephen pray For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire
Stevie had heard these words many times yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble For he feared the Lake of Fire He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath he must pray to be spared
Papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the Call Not George Townley or Ted certainly not Ludie Burt was at Hackettstown and Will at Albany Law School where they surely could not hear it Someday God would choose him He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa The stern face would relax the black-clad arms would embrace him My son Yet how might he know the Call when it came Probably as in Scriptures a still small voice would whisper It would summon him once if he missed it never again What if it came when he was playing or was asleep and dreaming
He must not fail to hear it He was Papa's chosen therefore nothing but good could happen to him even in God's wrathful storms When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley he was unafraid Aggie might fly into a closet shut the door and bury her head in the clothes he dared to wait for the lightning
Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner But he was good He clenched his fists and faced the terror Thunder crashed barrels tumbled down the mountainsides and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open Lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches not of Drew Church A flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions Violet whinnied from the stable
He ran out into the downpour sped across the yard and into the buggy room be afraid Violet He shouted and was aghast at the echoes you be afraid He would save her If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama first and Violet next Drenched and shaking he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle you be afraid Violet
After the storm the sky cleared blue and cool and fragrant air swept the hills When the sun came out Stevie strode proudly into Orange Square smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants The fountain had brimmed over the cannon were wet the soldiers' monument glistened Even before the benches had dried the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places The great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it He jumped The pointed shadow had nearly touched him
He trailed Ludie to the baseball game in the lot on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed
Go on home Ludie screeched at him tell Papa
No one told on Ludie not even when he slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box Ludie did as he pleased
Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows Ludie chewed roofer's tar Ludie had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July Ludie hopped rides on freight cars and was chased by Mr. Yankton the railroad guard He came home overheated ran straight to the ice-chest and gulped shivery cold water
Stevie envied him That Ludie He too cocked his cap at a jaunty angle jingled marbles in his pocket and swaggered down Main Street On the Christophers' lawn little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea party A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size Stevie yearned for a dog He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky
He meandered down Pike Street past the First National Bank with its green window shades He crossed the tracks to Delaware House where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah A tall lady with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom turned insolent green eyes upon him She was taller than Aggie She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked Fiddles screeched a piano tinkled
P. J. as Ludie called the town was crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the heat in the big cities They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses or at private homes Rich people went to Delaware House Opera House American House or Fowler House

If the crummy bastard could write how it should be those two fucken niggers Krist I wish they could write Nigger pussy He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy Oh sweet land of heaven there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy He thought of her the first one He had caught her coming out of the shack She was a juicy one Oh how they bounced Fresh warm sweet and juicy sweet lovin sixteen she was Man how I love nigger pussy The snow came a little faster now he noted He thought of Joe Harris the nigger who had gone after his sister He chuckled the memory vivid Jee-sus We Fixed him Yooee we fixed him The snow again If only the fucken weather so lousy Goddamn niggers Lord What I have to put up with Sonuvabitch I figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for Only one worth a shit and Brandon He so bad
His thoughts turned to other things The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for Kaboom for
He had been pretty scared himself wondering what the hell was coming off But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing Soon came back to his senses I soon came back to my senses he said aloud to the young blizzard proudly drawing himself up as if making a report to some important superior I was the first to get my squad on the ball and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb Look at thum That goddamn redheader was the worst He kept sayin not me not me I wind up like em But I told him goddammit I told him he said aloud get the guys that done it put the place back to normal Normal by God Maybe a good thing it happened Maybe stop it now once for all Clean the place up doin it now I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow get the guys that done it There was something troubling him though as yet they Five days Keerist Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him His eyes blinked hard snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him A tune began to whirl inside his head One of his favorites Guitar Boogie It always came on faithfully just like a radio or juke box whenever he started to worry too much about something when the bad things tried to push their way into him The music drove them off or away and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments humming and jiving within beating the rhythm within He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them Turn the bastards over to me to me and my boys no nigger ever got what would be comin to them reactionary bastards He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began It was a word he was proud of a word that meant much to him and he used it with great pleasure almost as if it were an exclusive possession and more he sensed himself to be very highly educated four cuts above any of the folks back home Four cuts at least he chuckled to himself and I owe it all to them The word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball It came up again and again in the discussion sessions Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months Months Hired hard lackeys of the Warmongering capitalists Not captured sent here To fuck up the program You guys remember that Remember that He heard himself haranguing them He saw himself before them delivering the speech He laughed suddenly feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them seeing himself before them receiving utmost respect and attention One day Ching had told him smiling patting him on the back as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders Keep it up your squad is good one of the best keep it up keep up the good work He would That was really something coming from Ching Really something he said aloud Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards get them by God and let them bring them down here to me just let them God slice their balls right off His arm moved swiftly violently once twice He felt intense satisfaction He was tingling within Before him mutilated bleeding to death they lay It was as if it had been done Bastards he said aloud spitting on them He halted and looked around Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him The thought came back the one nagging at him these past four days He tried to stifle it But the words were forming He knew he He braced himself start thinkin He fought it seeking to kill the last few words but on they came out He was trembling a strange feeling upon him fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot But it And he took heart the final word came forth Now he heard it fully bout takin his place He listened waited nothing happened He felt good His old self The music arrived taking him its rhythm Stroked him snaked all through him the lyrics lifted him took him from one magic isle to another stopping briefly at each Brandon He is good Damn good But a nigger Johnson Jesus the guy says he is trying But he with it not at all with it When I talked to Ching about it he said Everyone can learn if he is not a Reactionary or lazy No one is stupid what he said He know It is plain as hell Johnson is no reactionary So not tryin Johnson you bastard you He looked over at him lying there asleep and he felt a wave of revulsion How he loathed him Sleepy-eyed soft-spoken Johnson Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time Why they have dumped him off on someone else Why me Why the damn Reactionaries bump him off Why Slater Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind The music surged up but it failed to check it Who is the man to take His place The guy with most on the Ball Most on the ball Handle men Thoroughly Wised up Knows the score With a supreme effort he broke it off He turned to the window again A gnawing and gnashing within him The snow was tumbling down furiously now Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground piling higher and higher He stared at it amazed alarmed The whole fucken cavin in Keeeerist it Cover the whole building bury us all by nightfall Jesus Somebody got to be somebody If I put my two cents in soon somebody else will I know waitin only for one thing for the bastards what done it to be nailed Maybe they already got them He was again tingling with pleasure seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes Top dog sleeping and eating right there with the Staff Ching Tien all of them Top dog Poor ol Slater Jesus imagine the crummy bastards get em get comin to em He whirled about suddenly It was nothing though his heart was thumping wildly Somebody was up That was all
Boy stirrin early a sleepy voice said
Yehhh said Coughlin testily eyeing him up and down
that come down said the man scratching himself yawning
Yehhh said Coughlin practically spitting on him
The man moved away
the way toe the line Goddamn it Keep the chatter to a minimum short answers one word if possible Less bull the more you can do with em Brown's trouble All he does is to bullshit with his squad and they are the stupidest bastards around Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven Plenty of room there now All those dumb 8-Balls croaked You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how Anything cut their mothers' belly open Give um the works See already snapping it up the dumb jerk Coughlin grinned feeling supremely on top of things He watched the snow once again It infuriated him It made no sense to him He whirled around suddenly hot all over finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back nailing him to the spot on which he now stood open-mouthed
You Listen name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism Quick Quick now
The man shrank before the hot fury searching frantically for the answer
Finnegan woke up There was a hell of a noise this time of morning He stared out the window For Christ's sake The whole fucken caved in He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him It was that prick Coughlin What the hell was he up to now Why he drop dead How did they miss him when they got Slater How Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions What the Hell am I doin here Is this a nut-house Am I nuts Is this for real Am I dreamin
From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice
How long did you study How long buddy
For Christ's sake A voice pleaded
Christsake me buddy Just answer C'mon 'mon

Brandon dreamed He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water A river wide as the Missouri where it ran by his place The log was spinning But he was not So what Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning he asked this out loud but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut Over on the bank the west bank a man stood calling to him He make out what he was saying No doubt it had to do with the log Why should he be concerned

Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books too But while the two men are riding into the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves who strip them of everything including most of their clothes
You must be a very learned man says Voltaire to one of the bandits
A learned man The bandit laughs in his face
But Voltaire perseveres He goes to the chief himself At what university did you study He asks He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution To have become so corrupt he says surely you must have studied many arts and sciences
The chief annoyed by these questions knocks Voltaire down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school but never even learned how to read
When finally the two bedraggled men reach their friend's home Voltaire's fears are once again aroused For it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture
To Voltaire's surprise however their host gives them fresh clothes to put on opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner
Immediately after dinner however Rousseau asks for still another favor Could he have pen and paper please He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture
Such was the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe to be printed sometime later but with the name of Timon of Athens the famous misanthrope substituted for that of Rousseau
How cruel
But at the same time how understandable How could the rich for whom life was made so simple ever understand the subterfuges the lies the frauds the errors sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life
How for example could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when soon after the furor of his first Discourse he acquired still another title to fame
This time as a musician As a composer
Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera But his facility in this genre was not great And his efforts to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably failed And for good reasons His operatic music had little merit
But then one day while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler Rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written to which he attached no great importance He was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs
Put a few such songs together they urged him String them onto some sort of little plot and have a delightful operetta
He believe them Nonsense he said This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away
Heaven forbid Cried the ladies enchanted by his music You must make an opera out of this material
And they leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised
Oh the irony and the bitterness of it That after all his years of effort to become a composer he should now now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics of his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences be so close to a success in music and have to reject it
Or at least appear to reject it
But what else could he do You on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time practice them could you Well yes perhaps in literature since you could argue that you keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself But now music too No That would be too much
And the fault of course was Rameau's The fault was Rameau's and that of the whole culture of this Parisian age For it was Rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write and that he write These little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep
But no He appear as a composer now That glory craved for so long was now forbidden to him Still just for the ladies and just for this once for this one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his melodies
The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote
But then after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited
Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance The ladies especially understand what troubled him A contradiction Bah what was a contradiction in one's life Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes and saying yes when she meant no
Rousseau had to admit that though he agree to a public performance he would indeed just for his own private satisfaction dearly love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices
simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think he said
Duclos the historian pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible The musicians of the Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity
Rousseau agreed But he recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance of his opera Armide behind closed doors just for himself alone
Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau that the writer of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta That would certainly be paradoxical But Duclos thought he saw a way out
Let me do the submitting to the Royal Academy he suggested Your name will never appear No one will even suspect that it is your work
To that Rousseau could agree
But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions
Afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turned down which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author and that the work would be accepted and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself And how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks
All these emotions were screwed up to new heights when after acceptance and the first rehearsals there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King's amusements and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau Imagine the honor of it
What was your answer Jean Jacques asked striving to appear unimpressed
I refused Duclos said What else could I do Monsieur De Cury was incensed of course But I said I would first have to get the author's permission And I was certain he would refuse
How infuriating all this was Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial Now when everything was opening up to him even the court of Louis 15 he had to play a role of self-effacement
Back and forth Duclos had to go between M. De Cury and Jean Jacques and between the Duke D'Aumont and Jean Jacques again as his little operetta The Village Soothsayer though still unperformed took on ever more importance
And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends But they naturally kept his secret well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles
How titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals The furor was such that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration trembling lest his authorship become known and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer
He felt himself now as he himself says in his Confessions at a crucial point of his life And that was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace he did not bother to shave On the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days
Seeing him in that condition and about to enter the hall where the King the Queen the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present Grimm and the Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him
You go in that way They cried
Why not Jean Jacques asked Who is going to stop me
You dressed for the occasion They pointed out to him
dressed as I always am Rousseau said Neither better nor worse
At home yes they argued But here you are in the palace the King And Madame De Pompadour
If they are here then surely I have the right to be here Rousseau said And even more right Since I am the composer
But in such a slovenly condition
What is slovenly about me Rousseau asked Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with pride And those without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion Now times have changed and I must pretend that hair grow on my face the fashion And fashion is the real king here Not Louis 15 since even he obeys Now if you mind I should like to hear my own piece performed
But of course behind his boldness he feel bold at all He trembled lest his piece should fail And this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society his fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark And even deeper than that his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself Could he walk out in the midst of his piece Here before the court Before the King

It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began
The rider from Concord was as good as his word He came spurring and whooping down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust shouting
a-coming By God a-coming they are
We heard him before he ever showed and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight Solomon Chandler misjudged the strength of his lungs not at all I think you could have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every seam with importance I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle like as not prefer to eat his meals there understandable and I appreciate the sentiment As for this rider I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes I say but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction The last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation
We came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we crouched behind it I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant Whatever we felt about the redcoats we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing and I know that I myself was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun I wanted to wipe my flint but I dare to the state my hands were in just as I dare to do anything about the priming The gun would fire or not just as chance willed I put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it
The gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty and in that brief interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping his horse fit to kill I know whether he was after our rider who had gone by a minute before or whether he was simply scouting conditions but when he passed us by a musket roared and he reared his horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come He was a fine and showy rider but his skill was wasted on us From above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup Half crazed by the weight dragging the dust and the heat the horse leaped our wall dashing out the rider's brains against it and leaving him lying there among us while the horse crashed away through the brush
It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight but this grinning broken head not ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had become
And now the redcoats were coming and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us I must state that the faster things happened the slower they happened the passage and rhythm of time changed and when I remember back to what happened then each event is a separate and frozen incident In my recollection there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely Yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front of the British army came into view
It was only hours since I had last seen them but they had changed and I had changed In the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along trailing blood behind them No drummers here no pipers and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust They marched with bayonets fixed and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and torment Rank after rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same and they walked in a sea of dust
Committeemen hold your fire Hold your fire A voice called and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant only some of them glancing toward the stone wall from behind which the voice came
The front of their column had already passed us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not five paces from where we were My Cousin Simmons carried a musket but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite him he rose up behind the wall and fired One moment there was a man in the saddle the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks and during the next second or two we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers One moment the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death the next a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury
In the course of this they had fired on us but I have no memory of that I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew sobbing and shouting and aware that if I had passed water before it was not enough for my pants were soaking wet
I would have stood there and died there if left to myself but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there and then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far Everyone else was running Later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching
We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon's cow hole a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it Isaac Pitt one of the men from Lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly and though he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on the ground dying the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow It may appear that we were cruel and callous but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac except the Reverend I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball as Isaac had been yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself I was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road and the fact that I was not afraid now but only waiting to know what to do next
Meanwhile I reloaded my gun as the other men were doing We were less than a quarter of a mile from the road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it Wherever you looked you saw Committeemen running across the meadows some away from the road some toward it some parallel to it and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty Militia were making their way in our direction
Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road I offer any advice but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it the British would be gone but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts
While this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road It was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status and we felt that if they employed this tactic it was likely enough the best one Mattathias Dover said
It makes sense If we cluster together the redcoats can make an advantage out of it but not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us and we can outrun them
That settled it and we broke into parties of two and three Cousin Joshua Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac Pitt until life passed away and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world I went off with Cousin Simmons who maintained that if he see to me he know who would
Good heavens Adam he said I thought one thing have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place
I learned that now I said
We ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road panting from the effort and soaked with sweat There was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road and the shouting and gunfire never slackened
Under the trees there was a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes Three men were around him They had stripped him of his musket and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off Cousin Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away
God's name what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on Cousin Simmons roared
They tried to outface him but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him

That summer the gambling houses were closed despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux a gaming-card manufacturer Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied The slit breeches had to go Drunkenness was no longer tolerated In defiance a chinless reprobate Jake Camaret marched down the aisle in St. Peter's one Sunday morning followed by one of the women from the Bordel whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame Plunking themselves down on the front bench they turned to smirk at those around them
John's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him Calmly he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well He finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor God and man
The next morning as the clock struck nine he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected
I have told you before and I tell you again Monsieur Favre said rudely Stick to the preaching of the Gospel
John stiffened in anger That is the answer the ungodly will always make when the Church points its fingers at their sins I say to you that the Church will ever decry evil
John's reply was like a declaration of war Monsieur Favre sat down in his high-backed stall lips compressed eyes glinting Ablard Corne a short man with a rotunda of stomach rose Every eye was on him as he began to speak
What Master Calvin says is true How can we have a good city unless we respect morality
Abel Poupin a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes got to his feet We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together It would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers
Philibert Berthelier the son of the famous patriot disagreed Do not listen to that Frenchman He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win
John was quietly insistent There can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy
A week later the sentence of the Council was carried out Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace Before them stalked the beadle proclaiming as he went Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws adulterers thieves murderers and lewd persons Let evildoers contemplate their ways and let every man beware
John's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary Charles had died two weeks before in early November without being reconciled to the Church The canons in a body had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the Church but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith Burial had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned The Abbot of St. Eloi Claude De Mommor had been a good friend but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground
John closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's bedroom where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs The blue-draped Virgin was still there but no one knelt before her now Not even Varnessa she too prayed only to God For an instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte the touch of his mother's hand the lilt of Charles's voice in the square raftered rooms his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons and the sight of the beloved bishop But he had to follow the light Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy Scriptures why had He given them to him
The white-clad trees stood like specters in the February night Snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops as John trudged toward St. Peter's A carriage crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom The sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes his only ones now patched with folded parchment The city had recently given him a small salary but it was not enough to supply even necessities
As he neared the square a round figure muffled in a long black cape whisked by John recognized Ablard Corne and called out a greeting How grateful he was to such men There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians Despite their efforts the problems seemed to grow graver all the time Quickening his steps John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells Underneath the big one in the silent moonlight lay a dead pigeon and on the smaller bell the Clemence two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air
John leaned upon the stone balustrade He brushed back his black hair shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars He stood very still his arms at his sides staring up at the heavens then down at the blinking lights below
How long my Lord How long I have never asked for an easy task but I am weary of the strife
Sleep was difficult these days Indigestion plagued him Severe headaches were frequent Loneliness tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter Robert Nerien Nicholas Cop Martin Bucer and even the compromising Louis Du Tillet An occasional traveler from Italy brought news of Peter Robert who was now distributing his Bible among the Waldensian peasants Letters came regularly from Nerien Nicholas and Martin He had Anthony and William to confide in and consult But William continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church John found it difficult but he held him in check And Anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that His easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies
Geneva instead of becoming the City of God as John had dreamed had in the two years since he had been there continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished Refugees poured in signing the Confession and rules in order to remain and then disregarding them Dice rolled prostitutes plied their trade thieves stole murderers stabbed and the ungodly blasphemed Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope Master Calvin to curtail our liberty Why oh why he stick to preaching the Gospel instead of meddling in civic affairs politics economics and social issues that are no concern of the Church And John's reply was always the same Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church We will have righteousness
Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight Unless the confusion cleared he would not be coming here much longer Monsieur Favre's threat would become a reality for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of that Frenchman
The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie Faint at first the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind Eli Corault John thought What is he doing here at this hour He started down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher who had been one of the early Gospelers in Paris
John Is that you I came to warn you of a plot
John stood above him his face ashen What now Slowly like a man grown old he took Eli's hand and led him below to the tower study guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned
Plot John asked tiredly
Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit I went to your rooms and Anthony told me you were here Two Anabaptists Caroli and Benoit are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council It is to be a trap You know the law if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge you will be banished
What will be the subject
You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal
Anger and fear fused in John Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal Son of God were termed Arianists Peter Caroli had come to Geneva saying that he had been a bishop of the Church of Rome and had been persecuted in Paris for his Reformed faith He asked to be appointed a preacher But Michael Sept had unmasked him revealing he had never been a bishop but was an Anabaptist afraid to state his faith because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death So John had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher and now Caroli sought revenge
John sighed If William agrees we should insist on a public debate he said at length
There is more to the conspiracy Bern demands that the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to be with unleavened bread Furthermore Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council preach only the word of God and stop meddling in politics
It was always the spirit with Christ matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential Geneva must remain a sovereign state We will not yield to the demands of Bern
The firelight played over Eli's flowing white locks and rugged features Monsieur Favre indicated that if I would co-operate after you and William are banished following the debate I will be given a place of influence
What was your reply to that
That I would rather be banished with two such Christians than be made the Chief Syndic
The following morning as John entered the Place Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee he had a premonition of danger Then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him He wanted to run but he knew that if he did he would be lost He stood very still his heart thumping wildly On the outskirts of the rabble the Camaret brothers and Gaspard Favre shook their fists
Are you going to comply with the demands of Bern The chinless Jake called
Arianist A rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared Heretic
John lifted his hand for silence Know this the ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern His voice shook a little
Somebody heaved a stone For an instant John was stunned
When he felt the side of his head his fingers came away covered with blood Before he could duck another stone struck him And another
Let him be now Pierre Ameaux the gaming-card manufacturer said his little pig eyes glaring We have taught him a lesson
The crowd moved back and John started dizzily down the hill Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow At once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him One more horrible than the rest lunged growling deep in his throat his hair bristling With great difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run sweat pouring down his face

Standing in the shelter of the tent a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped no longer drumming Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beer barrels There was of course no real need to rearrange everything A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake or the toffee or the barley sugar or the sardines or the bitters or the condensed milk or the stationery or the needles what could it mean Adam watched his own hands make the caressing anxious movement that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles has been the ritual of stall vendors forever
He recognized the gesture He knew its meaning He had seen a dry old yellowing hand reach out with that painful solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object worth a pfennig Back in Bavaria he had seen that gesture and at that sight his heart had always died within him On such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever face it might be
Now the face was his own He wondered what expression as he made that gesture was on his face He wondered if it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism But there was no need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show concern or stoicism It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came Then why was he assuming the role the gesture and the suffering What was he expiating Or was he now taking the role the gesture and the suffering because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid befogged loneliness of this land
This was Virginia
He looked out of the tent at the company street The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street Beyond that misty gray of the rain he saw the stretching hutment low diminutive log cabins chinked with mud with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes or fence rails with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud The chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out In this heavy air however that device did not seem to help The smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the drizzle creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof
Over the door was a board with large inept lettering home sweet home This was the hut of Simms Purdew the hero
The men were huddled in those lairs Adam knew the names of some He knew the faces of all hairy or shaven old or young fat or thin suffering or hardened sad or gay good or bad When they stood about his tent chaffing each other exchanging their obscenities cursing command or weather he had studied their faces He had had the need to understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh behind the oath the banter the sadness Once covertly looking at Simms Purdew the only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy slack bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and had seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature He was seeing somehow the face of a young boy the boy Simms Purdew must once have been a boy with sorrel hair and blue eyes dancing with gaiety and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles
In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying I must not hate him I must not hate him or I shall die
His heart suddenly opened to joy
He thought that if once only once he could talk with Simms Purdew something about his own life and all life would be clear and simple If Simms Purdew would turn to him and say Adam you know when I was a boy it was a funny thing happened tell you now
If only Simms Purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told It would be a sign for the untellable and he Adam would understand
Now Adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the hut opposite his tent and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom snoring on his bunk with the fumes of whisky choking the air He saw the sign above the door of the hut home sweet home He saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street with an armful of wood
It was Pullen James the campmate of Simms Purdew He carried the wood carried the water did the cooking cleaning and mending and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his pains Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho It gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal Pullen James humbly lowered his head pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut and was gone from sight
Adam stared at the door and remembered that Simms Purdew had been awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at Antietam
The street was again empty The drizzle was slacking off now but the light was grayer With enormous interest Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him Into the emptiness of the street and his spirit moved a form
The form was swathed in an army blanket much patched fastened at the neck with a cord From under the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud The feet wore army shoes in obvious disrepair The head was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been flung The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle Moisture ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at the chin The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there The figure stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose Then the figure moved on
This was one of the Irish women who had built their own huts down near the river They did washing Adam recognized this one He recognized her because she was the one who in a winter twilight on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly Slice o' mutton bhoy She had queried in her soft guttural Slice o' mutton
Her name was Mollie They called her Mollie the Mutton and laughed Looking down the street after her Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket He could not make out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose
The words ran crazily in his head Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain
Then the words fell into a pattern Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose Scratching her nose in the rain Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain
The pattern would not stop It came again and again He felt trapped in that pattern in the repetition
Suddenly he thought he might weep the matter with me He demanded out loud He looked wildly around at the now empty street at the mud at the rain Oh the matter with me He demanded
When he had stored his stock in the great oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up the darkening street He would consign the cash box into the hands of Jed Hawksworth then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold Then he
Then what He did not know His mind closed on that prospect as though fog had descended to blot out a valley
Far off in the dusk he heard voices singing muffled but strong In one of the huts a group of men were huddled together singing He stopped He strained to hear He heard the words Rock of Ages cleft for me Let me hide myself in Thee Let the water and the blood From Thy riven side flow
He thought I am a Jew from Bavaria
He was standing there he thought in Virginia in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another Jew That other Jew a young man too had left that greatcoat behind in a rich house and marched away He had crossed the river which now beyond the woods yonder was sliding darkly under the mist He had plunged into the dark woods beyond He had died there
What had that man that other young Jew felt as he stood in the twilight and heard other men far away singing together
Adam thought of the hutments regiment after regiment row after row the thousands of huts stretching away into the night He thought of the men the nameless thousands huddling in them He thought of Simms Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by the hearth skirmishing an undershirt for lice and a wet log sizzled He thought of Simms Purdew who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield a maniacal scream on his lips and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him
He thought of Simms Purdew rising up fearless in glory He felt the sweetness of pity flood through him veining his very flesh Those men lying in the huts they did not know They did not know who they were or know their own worth In the pity for them his loneliness was gone
Then he thought of Aaron Blaustein standing in his rich house saying God is tired of taking the blame He is going to let History take the blame for a while
He thought of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier
He thought Only in my heart can I make the world hang together
Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut He saw Mose squatting by the hearth breaking up hardtack into a pan A pot was boiling on the coals give Ole Buckra all his money Mose asked softly
Adam nodded
Yeah Mose murmured yeah And look what he done give us
Adam looked at the pot What is it He asked
Chicken Mose said and theatrically licked his lips Gre't big fat chicken yeah He licked his lips again
Then yeah A chicken with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew And it squealed for slop Mose giggled Fooled you huh It is the same ole same tell me its name It is sowbelly with tits on It is salt po'k It is salt po'k and skippers That po'k it was so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say hoo-pig Had to put my foot on it to hole it down while I cut it up fer the lob-scuse
He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse Good ole lob-scuse he mumbled and stirred the pot He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder Know what Ole Buckra et tonight He demanded Know what I had to fix fer Ole Him
Adam shook his head
Chicken Mose said

She was a child too much a part of her environment too eager to grow and learn and experience Once they were at Easthampton for the summer again Fritzie said a good place even though they were being robbed One soft evening that marvelous sea-blessed time when the sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk Fritzie was on the couch reading Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away The infant in white terry-cloth bathrobe her face intense and purposeful had essayed a few wobbly steps toward her father Y'all walk walk he said Then gently he shoved her behind toward Laura Amy walked making it halfway across the cottage floor She lost not a second picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura Then Laura took her gently and shoved her off again toward Fritzie Amy did not laugh this was work concentration achievement In a few minutes she was making the ten-foot hike unaided soon she was parading around the house flaunting her new skill
Some liar's logic a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the window a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given her consoled her for a moment Amy had to be safe had to come back to them if only to reap that share of life's experiences that were her due if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her Through the swathings of terror she jabbed deceit's sharp point Amy would be reborn a new child with new parents living under new circumstances The comfort was short-lived yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion Gazing at her husband's drugged body his chest rising and falling in mindless rhythms she saw the grandeur of his fictional world that lush garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs She envied him She admired him
In the darkness she saw him stirring He seemed to be muttering his voice surprisingly clear Y'all should have let me take that money out Andrus said 'nother minute have been fine H'all should have let me do it
Laura touched his hand Yes I know Fritzie I should have
Tuesday The heat intensified on Tuesday Southern California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell drier more enervating more laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past It could continue this way hitting 106 and more in the Valley Joe McFeeley knew into October He and Irvin Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar Both had been up since 7:00 Irv on the early-morning watch McFeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour relief The night before they had telephoned the Andrus maid Selena Masters and she had arrived early bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and confounded Moll The latter thanking her for the coffee had winked and muttered Sure 'nuff honey Selena was the wrong woman for these crudities With a hard eye she informed Moll sure 'nuff me officer honey only to my husband understand Sergeant Moll understood The maid was very black and very energetic trim in a yellow pique uniform Her speech was barren of southernisms she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized minorities adopting the rolling R's and constricted vowels of Los Angeles Not seeing her dark intelligent face one would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood Village matron ten years out of Iowa After she had served the detectives coffee and toast they politely declined eggs uncomfortable about their tenancy she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market quotations While she was thus engaged McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day any recollections she had of people hanging around of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen of strange cars cruising the neighborhood She answered him precisely missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports Selena Masters Joe realized was her own woman She was the only kind of Negro Laura Andrus would want around independent unservile probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework and doubly efficient
When the parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later the maid greeted them quietly awful sorry about happened Selena said Maybe be a good-news day She charged off to the bedrooms
Moll took his coffee into the nursery During the night a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones Someone would have to remain in the office continually McFeeley greeted the parents then studied his notebook He wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file
Sleep well He asked
Andrus did not answer him His face was bloated with drugging redder than normal The woman had the glassy look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all Oh we managed she said a little groggy Did anything happen during the night
Few crank calls McFeeley said A couple of tips running down nothing promising We can expect more of the same Too bad your number is in the directory
occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had it listed Andrus muttered He settled on the sofa with his coffee warming his hands on the cup although the room was heavy with heat
The three had little to say to each other The previous night's horror the absolute failure overcast with the intrusions of the press had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness of play-acting Sipping their coffee discussing the weather the day's shopping Fritzie's commitments at the network all of which he would cancel they avoided the radio the morning TV news show even the front page of the Santa Luisa Register resting on the kitchen bar Kidnaper spurns ransom Amy still missing Once Andrus walked by it hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five-column lead of the article by Duane Bosch staff correspondent age not given and muttered We a national celebrities
McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to police headquarters in a half hour Before that he wanted to talk to the neighbors He did not want to bring the Andruses to the station house too early Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference and he want them subjected to the reporters again He could think of nothing else to tell them no assurances no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day When the detective left Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project Mrs. Andrus was talking to the maid arranging for her to come in every day instead of the four days she now worked
Outside only a handful of reporters remained The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference In contrast to the caravan of the previous night there were only four cars parked across the street Two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls He did not see Sparling or DeGroot or Ringel or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago However the litter remained augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers The street cleaner had not yet been around
One of the reporters called to him Anything new Lieutenant And he ignored him skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house When McFeeley was halfway to the door the proprietor emerged a mountainous dark man his head thick with resiny black hair his eyes like two of the black olives he imported in boatloads McFeeley identified himself The master of the house his nourished face unrevealing consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective
Inside as soon as Mr. Skopas had disclosed in a hoarse whisper the detective's errand his family gathered in a huddle forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait
It was amazing how they had herded together for protection an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper rising from the breakfast table a gross boy in his teens shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands a girl in her twenties fat and sullen descending the marble staircase then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor
They answered him in monosyllables nods occasionally muttering in Greek to one another awaiting the word from Papa who restlessly cracked his knuckles anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway No they seen anyone around no they know the Andrus family yes they had read about the case yes they had let some reporters use their phone but they would no longer They offered no opinions volunteered nothing betrayed no emotions Studying them McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined if they were they were never penalized whose children had no unhappy romances whose names never knew scandal The equation was simple wealth brought them happiness and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had let no one in on the secrets By comparison Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings They possessed no outer fortifications no hard shells of confidence they had enough difficulty getting from day to day let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them Skopas expressed no curiosity over the case offered no expression of sympathy made no move to escort McFeely to the door All four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left
He had spoken to Mrs. Emerson the previous day There remained a family named Kahler owners of a two-story Tudor-style house on the south side of the Andrus home Their names had not come up in any discussions with Laura and he had no idea what they would be like McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens each blade of grass cropped bright and firm each shrub glazed with good health
The door was answered by a slender man in his sixties straight-backed somewhat clerical in manner wearing rimless glasses When Joe identified himself he nodded unsmiling and ushered him into a sedate living room Mrs. Kahler joined them She had a dried-out quality a gray lean woman not unattractive Both were dressed rather formally The man wore a vest and a tie the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands of pearls
Funny thing Mr. Kahler said when they were seated when I heard you ringing I figured it was that guy down the block Hausman McFeeley looked puzzled Kahler continued I fixed his dog the other day and I guess sore so I expected him to come barging in Mr. Kahler went on to explain how Hausman's fox terrier had been making in his flower beds The dog refused to be scared off so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers He would lay in wait in the garage and when the terrier came scratching around let fly with a cherry bomb Scared the hell out of him Kahler grinned I hit him in the ass once Both grinned at the detective Finally all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life

In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room and then they went across the hall to the kitchen She was intimidated by the stove He found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her The gas flamed up two inches high They found the teakettle And put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox Several sections of a loaf of dark bread butter jam a tiny cake of ice In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry While she was settling the teacart he went back across the hall to their bedroom opened one of the suitcases and took out powdered coffee and sugar She appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows
Do you want to call Eugene
He but it was not really a question and so he left the room walked down the hall to the front of the apartment hesitated and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study A sleepy voice answered
Le petit dejeuner Harold said in an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan his high-school French teacher At the same time his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable peace-loving and dependable in everybody
Since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the plate of bread and butter and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water Stirring he said I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today
They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained
Harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water and then stirring he sat back in his chair The chair creaked Every time he moved or said something the chair creaked again
Eugene was not entirely silent or openly rude unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight and all it needed Harold thought was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it
Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street cartwheels a tired horse's plodding step voices Harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in Eugene told him and he promptly forgot They passed the marmalade the bread the black-market butter back and forth Nothing was said about hotels or train journeys
Eugene offered Harold his car to use at any time he cared to and when this offer was not accepted the armchair creaked They all three had another cup of coffee Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes
Excuse me he said in Berlitz English and got up and left them to bathe and dress
The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was At that moment the bathroom door flew open and Eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord and when the conversation came to an end Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment to his bathroom where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them Harold shook his head
Sabine called a few minutes ago Eugene said She wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night
He handed Harold a key to the front door and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment
When enough time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle of mahogany ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf It was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen Then came their bathroom and then a bedroom that judging by the photographs on the walls must belong to Mme Cestre A young woman who looked like Alix with her two children Alix and Eugene on their wedding day Matching photographs in oval frames of Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man who must be Alix's grandfather Mme Vienot considerably younger and very different The schoolboy And a gray-haired man whose glance direct lifelike and mildly accusing was contradicted by the gilt and black frame It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person Professor Cestre could it be
With the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there One of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet The curtains were of the same material and there were some big oil paintings portraits in the style of Lancret and Boucher
Though taken individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment as a whole formed a triangle The apex the study where Eugene slept was light and bright and airy and cheerful The window looked out on the Place Redoute it was the only window of the apartment that did Looking around slowly he saw a marble fireplace a desk a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors The daybed Eugene had slept in made up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows The portable record player with a pile of classical records beside it Beethoven's Fifth was the one on top Da-da-da-dum Music could not be Eugene's passion Besides the records were dusty He tried the doors of the bookcase Locked The titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires works on theology astral physics history biology political science No poetry No novels He moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room
The concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture a big round oak dining table and chairs a buffet with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame The suitcases had come while they were out and had been put in their room the concierge said
He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said Now what do we do
Call the Vouillemont I guess
I guess
Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered they had gone sight-seeing They went to the Flea Market expecting to find the treasures of Europe and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in Tours Cheap clothing and junk of every sort as far as the eye could see They looked even so Looked at everything Barbara bought some cotton aprons and Harold bought shoestrings They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad busy unpicturesque streets and coming home they got lost in the Metro it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute It was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole When he opened the door there stood Eugene on his way out of the apartment He was wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt and in his hand he carried a little black bag He did not explain where he was going and they did not ask Instead they went on down the hall to their room
Do you think he could be having an affair Barbara asked as they heard the front door close
Oh no Harold said shocked
Well this is France after all
I know but there must be some other explanation probably spending the evening with friends
And for that he needs a little bag
They went shopping in the neighborhood and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given in Blois and some cheese and a dozen eggs and a bag of oranges from a peddler in the Place Redoute the first oranges they had seen since they landed They had Vermouth sitting in front of a cafe When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment and thought how under different circumstances they might have stayed on here in these old-fashioned high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the Irelands' apartment in the East Eighties They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days
He went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom to turn on the hot-water heater and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks He felt them They were damp He reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub Damp also He looked around the room and then called out Come here quick
What is it Barbara asked standing in the doorway solved the mystery of the little bag There it is and there is what was in it But where do people go swimming in Paris That boat in the river maybe
What boat
a big boat anchored near the Place De La Concorde with a swimming pool in it you notice it But if he has time to go swimming he had time to be with us
She looked at him in surprise
I know he said reading her mind
I know what going to do with you
because we are in France he said and know so few people So something like this matters more than it would at home Also he was so nice when he was nice
All because I feel like dancing
I think it was that really
Then what was it
I know I wish I did The tweed coat maybe The thing about Eugene is that very proud
And the thing about hurt feelings the wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be For instance what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly as if this were the one moment they would ever have together their one chance of knowing each other
Fortunately the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields And in any case answers may clarify but they do not change anything

He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds' weight They took Jesus's body then and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial
Listed as present at the Descent were Mary Mary's sister Mary Magdalene John Joseph of Arimathea Nicodemus Search as he might he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary's last poignant moment
In his concept there could be no one else present
His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's asking for Christ's body Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes and the others had gone home to mourn Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses They would feel what Mary was undergoing There would be no halos no angels These would be two human beings whom God had chosen
He felt close to Mary having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey Now she was intensely alive anguished her son was dead Even though he would later be resurrected he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross In his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother only what Mary felt for her son Jesus' inert body would be passive his eyes closed Mary would have to carry the human communication This seemed right to him
It was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems Since his Christ was to be life size how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly His Mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child
There was only one way to accomplish this by design by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept
He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper Visually these approximated what he was feeling within himself At the same time he started walking the streets peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like how they moved In particular he sought the gentle sweet-faced nuns with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper
Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes he began a study of the anatomy of folds He improvised as he went along completing a life-size clay figure then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber to the consistency of thick mud No fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery had to serve organically to cover the Madonna's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ's body to intensify her inner turmoil When the cloth dried and stiffened he saw what adjustments had to be made
So sculpture commented Argiento wryly when he had sluiced down the floor for a week making mud pies
Michelangelo grinned See Argiento if you control the way these folds are bunched like this or made to flow you can enrich the body attitudes They can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone
He went into the Jewish quarter wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked The Jewish section was in Trastevere near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into Rome Here for the most part they were well treated as a reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians musicians bankers
The men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon Michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation When Michelangelo explained why he had come Rabbi Melzi replied gravely
The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images That is why our creative people give their time to literature not to painting or sculpture
But Rabbi Melzi you object to others creating works of art
Not at all Each religion has its own tenets
I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew I accomplish this if you will not help me
The rabbi said thoughtfully I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church
I am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi sure he would approve
What kind of models would you prefer
Workmen In their mid-thirties Not bulky laborers but sinewy men With intelligence And sensitivity
Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes
Leave me your address I will send you the best the quarter has to offer Michelangelo hurried to Sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber Together he and Argiento built the stand covering it with blankets
His first model arrived at dusk He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes He then draped him over the rough stand explained that he was supposed to be recently dead and was being held on his mother's lap The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting But at the end of the sitting when Michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the mother roughed in holding her son the model grasped what Michelangelo was after and promised to speak to his friends He worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi
Mary presented quite a different problem Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties old wrinkled broken in body and face by labor or worry His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother
Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes Here he sketched sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk young girls not yet twenty some about to be married some married a year or two Since the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes
He spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together a Mary who would be young and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap and a Jesus who though lean was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory without need to consult his sketches
Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay Here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms When he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or subtracted clay Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence He respected each of these approach techniques and kept them in character his quill drawings had a scratchiness suggesting skin texture the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh as in an abdomen in a reclining torso the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind they remained rough starting points When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model
The true surge had to be inside the marble itself Drawing and models were his thinking Carving was action

The arrangement with Argiento was working well except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice Argiento had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits up before dawn to scrub the floors whether they were dirty or not water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day the pots scoured with river sand after each meal
Argiento this is senseless he complained not liking to work on the wet floors particularly in cold weather too clean Scrub the studio once a week enough
No said Argiento stolidly Every day Before dawn I was taught
And God help anyone who tries to unteach you Grumbled Michelangelo yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about for Argiento made few demands on him The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them and in particular to see their horses The one thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing
Today I go see the horses
It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him He was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil He stumbled into the house eyes burning like fire Argiento made him lie down on the bed brought a pan of hot water dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned He assumed he could blink the splinter out But it would not come Argiento never left his side keeping the water boiled applying hot compresses throughout the night
By the second day Michelangelo began to worry and by the second night he was in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli Galli arrived with his family surgeon Maestro Lippi The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons He told Argiento to take a bird out of the cage cut a large vein under its wing let the blood gush into Michelangelo's injured eye
The surgeon came back at dusk cut the vein of a second pigeon again washed out the eye

Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps The thin legs twitched convulsively once then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands The child was gone
When Juanita awoke Kate was still rocking the dead child still crooning in disbelief No no oh no
They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister He sat beside Kate's bed with the others throughout the morning talking talking of God's will while Kate lay staring angrily at him When he told her God had called the child to Him she rejected his words rebelliously
Few of the neighbors came but Mrs. Tussle came called by tragedy It always comes in threes she sighed heavily Trouble never comes but in threes
They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment She would not accept the death of such a little child God called her to Him the minister had said God would not do that Kate thought stubbornly
Jonathan's letter came as she knew it would and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan's dictum and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God She held Jonathan's letter his words burning like a brand and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son Joel came and sat mutely with her sharing her pain and anguish averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom
Juanita and Mrs. Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty She disciplined herself daily to do what must be done She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the empty nursery although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby's death
Juanita drooped about the place wearing a haunted brooding look which Kate attributed to the baby's death until the day a letter came for her addressed to Miss Juanita Fitzroy bearing a Grafton postmark Seeing the slanting hand Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel The Federal forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains Kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended at what involvement existed for Juanita
Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty for more of the slaves including Annie had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss She loved him and missed his company
Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own What it was Kate could not fathom He claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs. Lattimer's funeral Joel knew what he was about however
get caught she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning
Not this old fox chuckled Uncle Randolph Everybody knows just a harmless deaf old man who takes to drink I aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure
Whiskey still my foot said Joel back there riding with the guerrillas the Moccasin Rangers
Hush said Uncle Randolph smiling or give you another black eye He patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back
Kate had no idea what they were talking of although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night had heard horsemen on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn Stranger Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle drunkenly singing Old Dan Tucker at the top of his voice Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house cold sober What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man
Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom Kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident had seen Joel's burning humiliation before Miss Snow's cold bespectacled wrath He had the hardest pains of growing before him now as he approached twelve These would be his hardest years she knew and he missed his father desperately
She tried to find some way to draw him out to help him Whenever she found time she went blackberry picking with him and they would come home together mouths purple arms and faces scratched tired enough to forget grief for another day He tended the new colts Beau had sired He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer's purple dusk
No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph They stayed in their own world on the bluff waiting for letters and the peddler bringing the news Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B & O Railroad The men were restive he wrote ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished
The peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling Which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains at Cheat and Rich mountains both and the Federal march on Beverly
Cleaned all them Rebs the hills they did They never git over inter loyal western Virginia them traitors The Federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too he crowed
After he had gone Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly Would you take their oath
And the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said Hell yes I think taken it about fifty times already Winking at Joel's look of shock
Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South And dear Kate she wrote poor Dr. Breckenridge's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South to his good father's sorrow Maj. Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the U.S. Army In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory
Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley Accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news
All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight the old man told them
In the next few days they had cause to rejoice It had been a big battle and the Confederate forces had won Jonathan and Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing Kate and Mrs. Tussle waited for letters anxiously Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful They all prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come for Virginia had defended her land victoriously
The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window They had already lost most of their corn she thought Were they to be insulted again because of the South's great victory She remembered McClellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs
At the landing she saw Juanita her face flushed pink with excitement run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door Juanita stopped just inside the open door her hand to her mouth As Kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore Kate greeted him gravely uneasy with misgivings at his visit
What brings you here again Colonel Marsh She asked taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun
I stopped to say goodbye Mrs. Lattimer and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby I wish our doctor could have saved her
It was a terrible loss to me said Kate quietly feeling the pain twist again at the mention knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton Where will you go now that leaving Parkersburg She asked him seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak
As you know General McClellan has been occupying Beverly He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac I am to go to Washington to serve with him
When are you to leave Kate asked watching them both now anxiously Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions she thought sadly
Tomorrow Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell Mrs. Lattimer
Stay here in the parlor where cool she said trying to be calm It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. Tussle not to see them
Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry She sought Kate out upstairs her lips trembling
He wants me to go with him tomorrow she told Kate
What do you want to do Kate asked uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma
I could go with him He knows me as your niece which of course I am But I am a slave You own me your decision said Juanita holding her face very still trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly
No the decision is yours I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer

The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky The two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years and they needed to say no more The things left unsaid they both felt deeply and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows Anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer and in the smell of scented candlewick the comforting awareness of each other's bodies the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered their minds grew numb and then empty of images They slept Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table
In the ballroom below the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows It was a delayed moon but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky Martha Schuyler old slow careful of foot came down the great staircase dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk her jeweled shoe buckles held forward
Well here at last she said addressing the old portraits on the walls I hear the music I am getting deaf I must admit it
She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it Where is everyone I say where is everyone Peter you lummox forgot to order the musicians
She stood there a large old woman smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning this big foolish baby of a son There were times now like this when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations Was it a birthday ball When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany from Rensselaerwyck And this handsome booby staring and sweating was he her bridegroom
Martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom
David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh He had ridden hard from Boston and he was not used to horseback Now driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move
The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on He would cross to Manhattan to Harlem Heights before morning There a certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news And he would sleep sleep and never think of roads and horses' sore haunches of colonial wars
Strange how everything here fitted back into his life even if he had been away so long Mynheer Sir Francis the valley society the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road A mist was walking on the water white as cotton but with a blending and merging grace
Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet He pulled out one of them and cocked it A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes It was a grotesque hen five or six feet tall It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers It ran this apocalyptic beast on two thin legs and its wings were they feathered arms flapped as it ran Its groin was bloody Black strips of skin hung from it
The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils David took a firm hand with it The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes glazed with an insane fear The ungainly bird thing ran away and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster Then it was gone He drove on wary and shaken The Sons were out tonight
Chapter 10 New York lay bleaching in the summer sun and the morning fish hawk flying in the heated air saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets mostly around the Battery going bravely north to Wall Street but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights From there it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses estates and big farms of the original non-Indian landowners began
On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields Husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences and there were grazing cattle On the shores north and south the fishers and mooncursers smugglers lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand Fire Island
The morning hawk hungry for any eatable killable digestible item kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay sheltered by the Jersey inlets They often threw tidbits overboard The larger ships were near Paulus Hook already being called by a few Jersey City These were the ships of His Majesty's Navy herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists The news of battle on Breed's Hill had already seeped through and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress The fish hawk his wings not moving circled and glided lower The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black the bronze cannon at the ports The captain's gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune
On shore the freed slaves to despotism the town dwellers watched the ships and waited The chevaux de frise those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber their rock paths led down to the Hudson Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms cattle barns and berry thickets Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County past the white church at Fishkill past Verplanck's Point on the east bank of the Hudson to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen Today tomorrow six months even perhaps a year
The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight The British ships rolled at anchor sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London Waited for more ships more lobster-backed infantry and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion
David Cortlandt having slept away a day and a night came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather looked out at King's Bridge toward Westchester The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual a carriage raising up the choking June dust and beyond in a meadow a local militia company drilling with muskets Kentuck' rifles every kind of horse pistol old sword or cutlass
The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston Pensive introspective he ached He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept Now there was more to do Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck
From the saddlebags hung on a Hitchcock chair David took out a good English razor a present from John Hunter He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost He hoped he was free of self-deception
Here he was suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface He knew that many were using it for their own ends But it did not matter He stropped the razor slowly what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born That some men did not want it he could understand The moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers Yet some like Morris Manderscheid would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas Unique circumstances would test us all he decided Injury and ingratitude would occur No doubt John Hancock would do well now war was a smugglers' heaven And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler's Things like that would increase rather than be done away with One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows David began to shave with great sweeping strokes
Time plays an essential part in our mortality and suddenly for no reason he could imagine or admit the image of Peg laughing filled his mind so desirable so lusty so full of nuances of pleasure and joy He drove sensual patterns off carefully shaving his long upper lip It is harder he muttered to meditate on man or woman than on God
David finished shaving washed his face clean of lather and combed and retied his hair He was proud that he had never worn a wig More and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder He felt cheerful again refreshed presentable in his wide-cut brown suit the well-made riding boots
It is so easy to falsify sentiment In the meadow below militia officers shouted at their men and on King's Bridge two boys sat fishing The future would happen he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days He began to pack the saddlebags And all this too shall pass away it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy yes in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires

Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way almost unchanged from feudal times Peasants puzzled Andrei He wondered how they could go on in poverty superstition ignorance with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish
Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine and before the national leadership exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert A fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference
Had he found the meaning too late It aggravated him The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich but no one seemed to care In the unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink
He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches When Alexander Brandel rose to speak the hall became silent
I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism We are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest seeking human dignity Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren eroded hills of Judea This is our singular goal How we travel through the forest is for each man's conscience Where we end our journey is always the same We all seek the same thing through different ways an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism It had sounded good to Andrei but he did not believe it In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine He loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright
Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex I only want to be a Pole Warsaw is my city not Tel Aviv
And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief Warsaw He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief Roman and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him They had let this black hole of death in Warsaw's heart exist without a cry of protest
Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they flirted from behind their fans
Warsaw Warsaw
Miss Rak I am a Jew
Day by day week by week month by month the betrayal gnawed at Andrei's heart He ground his teeth together I hate Warsaw he said to himself I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers' sons of them All of Poland is a coffin
The terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind What matters now What is beyond this fog Only Palestine and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe
By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front
At a siding another train which was a familiar sight these days Deportees Jews Andrei's skilled eye sized them up They were not Poles He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians
He walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka Of all the places in Poland Andrei hated Lublin the most The Bathyrans were all gone Few of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto
From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point He and Ana watched it carefully Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere Early in 1939 Odilo Globocnik the Gauleiter of Vienna established SS headquarters for all of Poland The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators
Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps Lublin was the seed of action for the final solution of the Jewish problem As the messages from Himmler Heydrich and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk Lublin's fountainhead spouted
A bevy of interlacing lagers work camps concentration camps erupted in the area Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin's web Plans went in and out of Lublin indicating German confusion A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names Lipowa 7 Sobibor Chelmno Poltawa Belzec Krzywy-Rog Budzyn Krasnik Ice baths electric shocks lashings wild dogs testicle crushers
The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken dope-ridden maniacs Lublin was their heart
In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin The ghetto a miniature of Warsaw's was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek As the camp emptied it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin then by deportees from outside Poland In and in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek but they never left and Majdanek was not growing any larger
What was happening in Majdanek Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area as they suspected
Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings His watch told him he was still early Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall He found an empty bench opened a newspaper and stretched his legs before him Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries
Captain Androfski
Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached homely face of Sergeant Styka Styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn I thought you might get in on a morning train
good to see you again Styka
Styka studied his captain He almost broke into tears To him Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby
Remember to call me Jan Andrei said
Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously When that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war
lucky that you were still living in Lublin
Styka grumbled about fate For a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces but one thing led to another I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married Not a bad girl So we have three children and responsibilities I work at the granary Nothing like the old days in the army but I get by Who complains Many times I tried to reach you but I never knew how I came to Warsaw twice but there was that damned ghetto wall
I understand
Styka blew his nose again
Were you able to make the arrangements Andrei asked
There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek I did exactly as instructed I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London
His answer
Ten thousand zlotys
Can he be trusted
He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you
Good man Styka
Captain Jan must you go inside Majdanek The stories Everyone really knows what is happening there
Not everyone Styka
What good will it really do
I know Perhaps perhaps there is a shred of conscience left in the human race Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation
Do you really believe that Jan
I have to believe it
Styka shook his head slowly I am only a simple soldier I think things out too well Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews I hated you when I first came in But my captain might have been a Jew but he a Jew What I mean is he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys Hell sir The men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name You never knew about it but by God we taught them respect for Captain Androfski
Andrei smiled
Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think Holy Mother we have behaved like this for hundreds of years Why
How can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see
But we are neither blind nor insane The men of your company would not allow your name dishonored Why do we let the Germans do this
I have sat many hours with this Styka All I ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country lost faith Styka I used to love this country and believe that someday win our battle for equality But now I think I hate it very much
And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do
The question frightened Andrei
Please go inside Majdanek
still a soldier in a very small way Styka
It was an answer that Styka understood
Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread Half of it dripped down his chin He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch
Well Andrei demanded
Grabski looked at the pair of them He grunted a sort of yes answer My cousin works at the Labor Bureau He can make you work papers It will take a few days I will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew I know if I can get you into the inner camp Maybe yes maybe no but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building
Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place
Orders from the Home Army
Why Nothing there but Jews
Andrei shrugged We get strange orders
Well what about the money
Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes Grabski had never seen so much money His broad flat fingers petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying snatched the bills clumsily This enough
You get the rest when safely out of Majdanek
I taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business
Andrei and Styka were silent

She was getting real dramatic have been more impressed if I remembered that played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course I want her back on that broken record
free in the whole goddam world was all I could think of to say When delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink
I am she said
forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me I was crazy about her all over again It was the call of the wild all right
That evening turned out to be hell like all the others We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill It was the same old routine Eileen got to dancing just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice and trying to pick up strange men but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness had together and there I was back on the hook
I did have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her met old friends and would be home late
I could scratch her eyes out Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth You know I like my men to have other women I hate it I hate it
She got so drunk I had to take her home It was a walk up on Hudson Street She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and let me go
There was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use What about Ballestre I had to shake her to make her listen Precious What about him
Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom We are above being jealous used to me bringing home strange men just tell him my husband He object to that
Well I object If he pokes his nose in here slug him
That really would be funny
She began to laugh She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed After all made of flesh and blood not a plaster saint
Waking up was horrible Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything done as I did about spending that night with my own wife
We both had hangovers Eileen declared she lift her head from the pillow She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot I was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell There was somebody else in the apartment
I stiffened Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight I turned around with the percolator in my hand My eyes were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora Brown eyes eyebrow mustache Oval face without an expression in the world
We have time to speak before Eileen's voice was screeching at us from the bed Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman Exboyfriend meet exhusband She gave the nastiest laugh I ever heard And either of you forget that not any man's property If you want to fight go down on the sidewalk She was enjoying the situation Imagine that
Eileen was a psychologist all right Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him Maybe he felt the same way I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers
I face Thelma after that night I even have the nerve to call her on the telephone I wrote her that met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express Of course I had to give her Eileen's address but she never came near us All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever She never said a word about the fifty dollars She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times
Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away That finished me with Thelma Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation
And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship I felt it and it ate on me all the time but I know how right I was till later
What I did know was that Precious was always around He slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs Who do you think pays the rent You have me throw the poor boy out on the street Eileen said when I needled her about it I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she want to hear Still I think she was twotiming me with Precious right then To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night
Precious had me worried I make out what his racket was thought him a pimp or procurer but he seem to be He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work
I never could find out what his business was He always seemed to have money in his pocket The phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger Now and then he would disappear for several days Connections was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions Oh just an international spy Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh
Poor devil he have been too happy either He got no relief from drink because though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening leave it on the table untouched
When I was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess Occasionally if I pushed him too far give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his Some day I told Eileen that guy will kill us both She just listen
Getting drunk every night was the only way I could handle the situation Eileen seemed to feel the same way We still had that much in common The trouble was drinking cost money The way Eileen and I were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life but when that was gone I have a cent I know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer come to town
Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he have Jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm He was a big thick beefy violent man Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything
Pat took Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again Whom God hath joined etcetera The O'Dwyers were real religious people except for Kate Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief Pat had been worried as hell ever since lost her job on that fashion magazine It had gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art And Apparel How about me trying to help her get her job back
All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with But brother I take a job right now she said with her eyes on her ice cream going to have a baby Francis Xavier's baby my own husband's baby
My first thought was how had it happened so soon but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough been living together six weeks Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment Greatest thing that ever happened Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey and have to quit drinking come East for the christening by God he would When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen's hand to help towards a layette
Before he left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job Pat had contacts all over the labor movement A friend of Pat's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union
The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves Most of them were elderly men It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York They as well paid as they should have been One reason the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen
Sposato needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook local There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement For once radicalism was a recommendation
Sposato wait to get me hired With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff The things a man will do for a woman

There was one fact which Rector could not overlook one truth which he could not deny As long as there were two human beings working together on the same project there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave No matter how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions
Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel He was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two were intertwined and could not be separated He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated the Communists in the village rooted out the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant too But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving indefatigable force for good in the world
He sighed How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice He would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse In any event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning
Hino was elated at the prospect He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor an excellent place to make contact with the enemy He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions He was to get involved in no arguments he was to try to make no converts he was simply to listen and report back what he heard
It was a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it for Hino frankly partisan openly gregarious would make a poor espionage agent If he wanted to know anything he would end up asking about it point-blank but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection In all of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino From the moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job any job his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand he had been ready to become a Christian He had already been studying the Bible he knew the fundamentals and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that
Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino's past Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject Putting the pieces of this mosaic together Rector had the vague outlines of a biography Hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in Chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat Without exception Hino's brothers turned to either one or both of their father's occupations but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller He had gone into the Japanese navy had been trained as an officer had participated in one or two battles he never went into detail regarding his military experience and at the age of twenty-five quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian Rector was often curious often tempted to ask questions but he never did If and when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so unasked
Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto liberally embellished with his active imagnation When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important He was surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other end of the line He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the secretary said businessmen from Tokyo for the most part and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it
Oh Rector said I guess it will be all right When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here
This afternoon the secretary said At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time
All right Rector said I will be expecting them
He was about to hang up the phone but a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation open He had something more to say I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers he said
Rector laughed despite himself Unless the oyabun has been working on it he said then checked himself and added You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use
Arigato gosaimasu The secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector's hand
Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all the available information it was probably the latter Kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village At the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity No Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived
When he had given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds Fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn Rector asked him to move it for the time being he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless A good initial impression would be important now He went into the print shop where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press
How many pamphlets do we have in stock Rector said
I should say about a hundred thousand Fletcher said Why
I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon Rector said He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create the picture of a very busy mission He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested
Rector's next stop was at the schoolroom where Mavis was monitoring a test He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside He told her of the visitors and then of his plans How many children do you have present today He said
She looked back toward the schoolroom Fifteen she said No only fourteen The little Ito girl had had to go home She has a pretty bad cold
I would like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exuberant full of life I want to create the impression of a compound full of children Do you think you can manage it
Mavis smiled try
As Rector was walking back toward the residential hall Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident I think fixed the pump so we have to worry about it for a long time he said adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low Fine Rector said He looked out over the expanse of the compound It was going to take a lot of activity to fill it Have you ever operated a transit He said No sir Johnson said
You are about to become a first-class surveyor Rector said When Konishi gets back with the jeep I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys Konishi can help you find an old transit in the basement The glass is out of it but that matter It looks pretty efficient and the important thing He went on to explain what he had in mind Johnson nodded He said he could do it
Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall It was rather a childish game all in all but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much He was not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it He was not going to lose the mission by default and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise
He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take charge of the office while the party was here When everything had been done Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock
At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi's party Then Rector attired in his best blue serge suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a tree smoking a cigarette and waiting The air was cooler here and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect which he found pleasant

She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient
The fish took the bait He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger but joy of joys he would be at home at the hour mentioned
But when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement She was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose She wrote again and now abandoning for the moment the theme of love she asked for help in the matter of her career She could act and she could write His lordship was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but if there were no opportunities there would he read and criticize her novel
At last he consented to meet her and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal
Have you any objection to the following plan On Thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles There we shall be free and unknown we can return the following morning
She concluded by asking for a brief interview to settle with you where and she threw in a tribute to his gentle manners and the wild originality of your countenance
She opened his reply with trembling fingers he agreed And he would see her that evening Victory at last
At their meeting he told her not to bother about where he would attend to that There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and as Claire rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left She sang him Scott's charming ballad Rosabelle which was the vogue of the moment She had never sung better
Your voice is delightful he approved with a warm smile Tomorrow will be a new experience I have never before made love to a nightingale There have been cooing doves chattering magpies thieving jackdaws a proud peacock a silly goose and a harpy eagle whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals
And so they went he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington one of the leaders of the so-called Order Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this it seems was not employed for self-flagellation Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities
The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish Alas all that belonged to the age of Devil Dashwood and Wicked Wilkes abbot and beadsman of the Order The casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison
They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace the air about them scented with stock and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden Charming and peaceful but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure Alone with the fabulous Byron How many women had longed for the privilege that was hers
How was she to behave Claire wondered To be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might well be an equal handicap No she would not pretend modesty but neither must she be crudely bold Mystery that was the thing In the bedroom she would insist on darkness With his club foot he might well be grateful
At the inn which was situated close to a broad weir Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as milord The place was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown
The fire in the sitting room was lighted
What about the bedroom Byron inquired Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell
We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney milord but I promise you never have trouble of that sort again
So not only had he been here before but it seemed he might well come again Claire felt suddenly small and cheap heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan
A cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port When Napoleon's ship had borne him to Elba French wines had started to cross the Channel the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled
As they waited for supper they sat by the fire glasses in hand while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers
Sex is overpriced he said The great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate not man against man for the prize of a woman's body So see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance
The gods seemed to think sex pretty important she rebutted Mars and Venus Bacchus and Ariadne Jupiter and Io Byron and the nymph of the owl's nest That would be Minerva I suppose the owl her symbol
Byron laughed So you know something of the classics do you
Tell me about Minerva how she behaved what she did to please you
tell you nothing I ask you who being unfaithful to husband or lover Frankly I care
For a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind
Very well she said not catechize you What matter the others so long as I have my place in history
She was striking the right note No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed with one so favored flattery could hardly seem overdone Brains and beauty high position in both the social and intellectual worlds athlete fabled lover if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his
The light supper over Claire went to him and slipping an arm about his shoulder sat on his knee He drew her close and hand on cheek turned her face to his Her lips moist and parted spoke his name
Byron
His hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown then to better purpose he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers untied it The bodice beneath was buttoned and withdrawing his lips from hers he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it unhurriedly as if she were a child
But kindled by his kiss his caressing hand her desire was aflame She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom Lord Byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color He drank slowly with due appreciation It was an excellent vintage
He rose and went to the bedroom Pausing in the doorway he said The form of the human female unlike her mind and her spirit is the most challenging loveliness in all nature
When Claire returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron's mistress By odd coincidence on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina which was the latest of the titled poet's successes As he declaimed the sonorous measures it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings
Although it is not the best of which he is capable said Shelley as he closed the book it is still poetry of a high order
If he would only leave the East said Mary I am tired of sultans and scimitars
The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte said Claire with slightly overdone carelessness
How do you know that Demanded Mary
I was told it on good authority Claire answered darkly I tell I tell she repeated to herself I promised him I
Chapter 9 winter came and with it Mary's baby a boy as she had wished William he was called in honor of the man who was at once Shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter
Fanny and Mrs. Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement and that her child is well
At the same time another child this one of Shelley's brain was given to the world Alastor a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind's musings Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked contemptuously ignored Shelley sent a copy to Southey a former friend and another to Godwin Neither acknowledged the gift
Only Mary's praise sustained him in his disappointment She understood completely Not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation
You have made the labor worth while he said to her smiling And in the future since I write for a public of one I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money
A public of one Mary echoed reprovingly How can you say such a thing There will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor There are some even now What about that dear clever Mr. Thynne I am sure he is in raptures
Poor Mr. Thynne he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement
There are other Mr. Thynnes Not everyone is bewitched by Byron's caliphs and harem beauties
Mary's supercritical attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute She was resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley's failure The same month that Alastor was published Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege Of Corinth a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley's generosity rebelled at
The lordly poet was at low-water mark The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent On all sides doors were being slammed in his face The previous scandals gaily diverting as they were had only served to increase his popularity Now under the impact of his wife's disclosures he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance however brilliant however far-famed the offender might be He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister but he soon saw as did she that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin For the moment there was no woman in his life and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity
But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing Byron since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes

Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel He had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel's belt Despite his yearning the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines He would remain in the tent waiting impatiently occupied by some trivial task
Beckworth
Sir
Fetch me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months
The last six months sir
You heard me a lot of waste going on here got to stop I want to take a look This is no damned holiday Beckworth Get busy
Yes sir
Beckworth left the tent Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank He glanced back The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs methodically tearing at his thumbnail
The bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank From the outside it seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor Two slits enabled observers to watch across the river The place smelled strongly of rank fertile earth rotting wood and urine The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson's boots At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle There was no place to sit but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams In the corner was the soldier with the white flag He stood stiffly erect clutching the staff his body half hidden by the limp cloth Watson hardly looked at him The man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant brandishing the flag of truce Someone had hauled him over the side and he had remained silent while they crossed
An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer two of them calling him Billy When the boat had touched the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof The officer had told him that both lists must be checked Watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass The officer surprised said he would have to see Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later He had peered through the darkness at the rampart The men he would take back across the river stood there but he turned away from them He wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof but the soldier had followed him Though Watson carefully ignored the man he could not deny his presence Perhaps it would be better to speak to him since silence could not exorcise his form Watson glanced briefly at him seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner
We be too long If my pass is approved I may be a half hour
The soldier answered in a curious muffled voice his lips barely moving Watson turned away and did not see the man's knees buckle and his body sag
Yes sir
He had acknowledged the man It was easier to think now Watson decided The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts He paced slowly stooping staring at the damp slippery floor He tried to order the words of the three Union officers seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy But he groped blindly His lack of success steadily eroded his interest He stopped pacing leaned against the dank timbered wall and let his mind drift A feeling of futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known seeped through him What in the name of God was he doing crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river Why had he crossed the dark water to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole
He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion He was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity Hillman had written it all out he the report official enough What did he hope to accomplish here Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank Prompted by a guilty urge he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected For what To tell John something he would find out for himself
The figure in the corner belched loudly a deep liquid eruption Watson snorted and then laughed aloud Exactly
The soldier's voice was muffled again stricken with chagrin He clutched the staff and his dark eyes blinked apologetically
'scuse me sir
get out of here
Watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds To his left the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current A soldier held the end of a frayed rope
Three Union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready Watson stared at them curiously They were stocky men well fed and clean-shaven with neat uniforms and sturdy boots Behind them shambled a long column of weak tattered men The thin gray figures raised a hoarse cawing cry like the call of a bird flock They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness elbowing and shoving Four men were knocked down but did not attempt to rise They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs The crawling men tried to rise and fell again No one moved to them Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly In a confused soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms the two men were dragged into the same skiff The third crawling man forced himself erect He swayed like a drunkard his arms milling in slow circles He paced forward unsteadily leaning too far back his head tilted oddly His steps were short and stiff and with his head thrown back his progress was a supercilious strut He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge his weight nearly swamping the craft Watson looked for the fourth man He had reached the three passive guards he crept in an incertain manner patting the ground before him The guards did not look at him The figure on the earth halted seemingly bewildered He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound Then he began to crawl again Watson watched the creeping figure He felt a spectator interest Would the man make it or not If only there was a clock for him to crawl against If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes say then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud Say three minutes to make it sporting Still the guards did not move but stood inert aloof from the slow-scrambling man The figure halted and Watson gasped The man began to creep in the wrong direction deceived by a slight rise in the ground He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart Watson raced for him his boots slamming the soft earth
The guards came to life with astonishing menace They spun and flung their rifles up Watson gesticulated wildly One man dropped to his knee for better aim
Let me help him for the love of God
The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen puzzled faces Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped panting heavily He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm Beneath his clutch a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet Watson stared into a cadaverous face Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids Light sticks of fingers the tips gummy with dark earth patted at Watson's throat The man's voice was a sweet patient whisper
Henry said that take my arm and get me right there But you Henry
no
It matter Is it far
How far could it be Watson thought bleakly how far can a blind man crawl Another body length or all the rest of his nighted life
Not far
You talk deep Not like us fellas It raises the voice bein in camp You Secesh
yes Come on now Can you walk
Why course I can I can walk real good
Watson stumbled down the bank The man leaned his frail body against Watson's shoulder He was no heavier than a child Watson paused for breath The man wheezed weakly his fetid breath beating softly against Watson's neck His sweet whisper came after great effort
Oh Christ I wish you was Henry He promised to take me
hush almost there
Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff The man swayed on a thwart turning his ruined eyes from side to side Watson turned away sickened for the first time in many months He heard the patient voice calling
Henry Where are you Henry
Make him lie down
Watson snatched a deep breath He had not meant to shout He stood with his back to the skiff The men mewed and scratched begging to be taken away Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches
Goddamn you What do you do to them
Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly He was angry sickened He had not felt that during the afternoon No nor later All his emotions had been inward self-conscious In war on a night like this it was only the outward emotions that mattered what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others Yes That was it He was sure of it
John's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen What a fool he had been to think of his brother So Charles was dead What did it matter His name had been crossed off a list Already his cool body lay in the ground What words had any meaning What had he thought of to go to John grovel and beg understanding To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go Men were slaughtered every day tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute What made him think John had a right to witness his brother's humiliation What right had John to any special consideration Was John better more deserving To hell with John Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman's beautiful schoolmaster's hand John would curse He believed that brave boys cry
Watson spat on the ground He was grimly satisfied He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering

I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming O Gogol O Chekhov O Thackeray and Dickens what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks a birdbath and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps As I say I want to begin a day like this but I often wonder what the dead would have done But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge I can see it from this window where I write It was built by the Pasterns and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property It bulks under a veil of thin new grass like some embarrassing fact of physicalness and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning It would have been like her She was a pale woman Sitting on her terrace sitting in her parlor sitting anywhere she ground an axe of self-esteem Offer her a cup of tea and she would say Why these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year Show her the new swimming pool and she would say slapping her ankle I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes Hand her a chair and she would say Why a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy These trumps were more touching than they were anything else and seemed to imply that the nights were long her children ungrateful and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare Twenty years ago she would have been known as a golf widow and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement She usually wore weeds and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr. Pastern was dead but Mr. Pastern was far from dead He was marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting Bomb Cuba Bomb Berlin throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them boss He was brigadier of the club's locker-room light infantry and at one time or another declared war on Russia Czechoslovakia Yugoslavia and China
It all began on an autumn afternoon and who after all these centuries can describe the fineness of an autumn day One might pretend never to have seen one before or to more purpose that there would never be another like it The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year's lights Leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled for all its ammoniac acidity of beginnings The boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum Leaving her house one late afternoon Mrs. Pastern stopped to admire the October light It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis Mrs. Pastern had been given sixteen names a bundle of literature and a printed book of receipts It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks Her house stood on a rise of ground and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal and almost every roof she saw signified charity Mrs. Balcolm worked for the brain Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health Mrs. Trenchard worked for the blind Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat Mrs. Trempler was tuberculosis Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers' March of Dimes Mrs. Craven was cancer and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney Mrs. Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton's house a roof that signified gout
Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer It was her destiny it was her life Her mother had done it before her and even her old grandmother who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers Mrs. Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance and most of them were ready for her She experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry The contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year and while the money of course was not hers it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks She stopped at the Surcliffes' after dusk and had a Scotch-and-soda She stayed too late and when she left it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund she said excitedly when he walked in I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner
But I know the Flannagans Charlie Pastern said
Nobody does but they gave me ten last year
He was tired he had his business worries and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins' thinking that they might give him a drink But the Blevins were away their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door Turning in at the Flannagans' driveway he tried to remember if he had ever met them The name encouraged him because he always felt that he could handle the Irish There was a glass pane in the front door and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers
Infectious hepatitis he shouted heartily
She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and walking with very small steps started toward the door Oh please come in she said The girlish voice was nearly a whisper She was not a girl he could see Her hair was dyed and her bloom was fading and she must have been crowding forty but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight Your wife just called she said separating one word from another exactly like a child And I am not sure that I have any cash any money that is but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook you step into the living room where cozier
A fire had just been lighted he saw and things had been set out for drinks and like any stray his response to these comforts was instantaneous Where was Mr. Flannagan he wondered Travelling home on a late train Changing his clothes upstairs Taking a shower At the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers and she began to riffle these making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting she said but you make yourself a little drink while you wait on the table
What train does Mr. Flannagan come out on
Mr. Flannagan is away she said Her voice dropped Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks
have a drink then if have one with me
If you will promise to make it weak
Sit down he said and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later The only way to find things is to relax
All in all they had six drinks She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly Mr. Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors He travelled all over the world She like to travel Planes made her feel faint and in Tokyo where she had gone that summer she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home She and her husband had formerly lived in New York where she had many friends but Mr. Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom She had no children she had made no friends seen you though before she said with enormous coyness patting his knee seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible
The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him although he was even more touched by her plumpness Sheer plumpness he knew is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions It serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass And knowing its humble place in the scale of things why did he at this time of life seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he know what to make of them but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there
never done this before she said later when he was arranging himself to leave Her voice shook with feeling and he thought it lovely He doubt her truthfulness although he had heard the words a hundred times never done this before they always said shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders never done this before they always said waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor never done this before they always said pouring another whiskey never done this before they always said putting on their stockings On ships at sea on railroad trains in summer hotels with mountain views they always said never done this before
Where have you been Mrs. Pastern asked sadly when he came in after eleven
I had a drink with the Flannagans
She told me he was in Germany
He came home unexpectedly
Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news Bomb them He shouted Throw a little nuclear hardware at them Show them boss But in bed he had trouble sleeping He thought first of his son and daughter away at college He loved them It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf choosing his handicap his irons his stance his opponents and his weather in detail but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries His money was tied up in a Nassau hotel an Ohio pottery works and a detergent for window-washing and luck had been running against him His worries harried him up out of bed and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying like leaves in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga Maple and ash beech and elm one hundred to win on Three in the fourth fifty to win on Six in the third one hundred to win on Two in the eighth Children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage Then getting back into bed he thought unashamedly of Mrs. Flannagan planning where they would next meet and what they would do There are he thought so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed as it did a little crude

It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives two marriages two births one divorce Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years Her thoughts were not discrete But there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons
She grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird alert for flight She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters one to Abel one to Mark
Once her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against the paper the words came sharply smoothly as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips And the stiffly regal look of them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string Please come down as soon as you conveniently can the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen I have an important matter to discuss with you To Abel I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters You may stay as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in To Mark Please give my regards to Myra
She signed the letters quickly stamped them and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water
My nephews will be coming down she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray She looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way they had faded to a near-absence of color which had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of the light of the sea in them
Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth She smiled and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face That will be so nice for you Mrs. Packard she said Her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose
Um said the old lady and brought her eyes down to the tray You remember them I suppose She glinted suspiciously at the dish before her blowfish I hope Raphael bought them whole
Angelina stepped back her eyes roaming the tray for omissions Then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm
Yes she said I remember that they came here every summer I used to play with the older one sometimes when let me Abel The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile She would have said triumph Then Angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen
Jessica Packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway then she snorted and groped for her fork
no greater catastrophe in the universe she reflected dourly impaling tender green beans on the silver fork than the dwindling away of a family Procreation expansion proliferation these are the laws of living things with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments oblivion When the fate of the individual is visited on the group then the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ah then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth
She was the last living of the older generation What had once been a widespread family at one time she knew there were enough Packards to populate an entire county had now narrowed down to the two boys Abel and Mark She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans What hope lay in the nephews she asked the intensifying light out there with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced having sired two girl children with none to bear on the Packard name
She ate It seemed to her as it seemed each night that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows Here too she talked low quirking her head at one or another of the places most often at Izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years
She thought again of her children those two who had died young before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies The girl her first she barely remembered It could have been anyone's infant for it had not survived the bassinet But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday Each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her He ran on his plump sticks of legs freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs all carefully placed and glued and labeled resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged quick with the delight of laughter and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea
The brothers drove down together in Mark's small red sports car Mark at the wheel They rarely spoke Abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading out from both sides of the road rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields He saw the land with a stranger's eyes all the old familiarness gone And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger impervious complete in itself There was stability there too a color which his life had had once That is what childhood is he told himself Solid settled lost In the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica's letter What bad grace what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown The boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might never have been They had closed over absolutely with the sealing of old Izaak's grave The small car flew on relentlessly The old woman stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality Abel moved and adjusted his long legs
I suppose it has to do with the property Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness He and Mark were the last of the family and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer
Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother Mark held the wheel loosely but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure make in the years to come His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides and Abel looked quickly away Mark easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably categorized
The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea She mention bringing Myra Mark said maneuvering the car into the next lane probably getting old crotchety I mean and we figured uh-uh better not never met you know But Myra budge without an express invitation I feel kind of bad about it He gave Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel hugging it to him and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt
I imagine the old girl missed us much Mark added his eyes on the road Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation He smiled It was barely possible that his brother was right
He could tell they were approaching the sea The air took on a special strength now that left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind There was the smell of the coast like a primeval memory composed of equal parts salt water clams seaweed and northern air He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone house which built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor had been Izaak's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended
Mark's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant Remember the Starbird Mark asked and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down
The Starbird Abel said There was the day Uncle Izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could They seemed then to have had a single mind and body a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually He saw the Starbird as she lay her slender mast up and gently turning its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting ready for the two of them to run up her sails The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay
They came unexpectedly upon the sea Meeting it without preparation as they did robbed of anticipation a common disappointment seized them They were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars

His eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky glare at my noise growing red and raising up his rage I decided I hated the Pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while I was away where I watch dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling Oh not care about the Pedersen kid not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain That would make him mad enough if he was sober I hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen
He was all shoveled up like I thought be I pushed at his shoulder calling his name I think his name stopped the snoring but he move except to roll a little when I shoved him The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but his face was turned to the wall there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster and I thought Well you look much like a pig-drunk bully now I be sure he was still asleep He was a cagey sonofabitch I shook him a little harder and made some noise Pap-pap-pap-hey I said
I was leaning too far over I knew better He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him Oh he was smart It put you off I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck watering my eyes and I backed off to cough Pa was on his side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow
Get the hell out of here
I say anything trying to get my throat clear but I watched him He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear It was better though hit me He was bitter when he missed
Get the hell out of here
Big Hans sent me He told me to wake you
A fat hell on Big Hans Get out of here
He found the Pedersen kid by the crib
Get the hell out
Pa pulled at the covers He was tasting his mouth
The froze good Hans is rubbing him with snow got him in the kitchen
Pedersen
No Pa the Pedersen kid The kid
Nothing to steal from the crib
Not stealing Pa He was just lying there Hans found him froze where he was when Hans found him
Pa laughed
I hid nothing in the crib
You understand Pa The Pedersen kid The kid
I goddamn well understand
Pa had his head up glaring his teeth gnawing at the place where grown a mustache once
I goddamn well understand You know I want to see Pedersen That cock Why should I What did he come for hey God dammit get And come back Find out something a fool Both you and Hans Pedersen That cock come back Out Out
He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow He had long black hairs on his wrist They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt
Big Hans made me come Big Hans said
A fat hell on Big Hans an even bigger fool than you are Fat hey I taught him dammit and teach you Out You want me to drop my pot
He was about to get up so I got out slamming the door He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep Then he threw things Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister been shit-sick in that pot Hans got an axe He even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before he stopped He might not have gone that far if Pa been locked in laughing fit to shake the house That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it I always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs
Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid's chest and stomach He was rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough was turning pasty sticking to the kid's back and behind
he going to wake up
What about your pa
He was awake when I left
he say Did you get the whisky
He said a fat hell on Big Hans
be smart Did you ask him about the whisky
Yeah
Well
He said a fat hell on Big Hans
be smart he going to do
Go back to sleep most likely
best get that whisky
You go Take the axe scared to hell of axes
Listen to me Jorge had enough to your sassing This froze bad If I get some whisky down him he might die You want the kid to die Do you Well get your pa and get that whisky
Pa care about the kid
Jorge
Well he He care at all and I care to get my head busted neither He care and I care to have his shit flung on me He care about anybody All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face Get pig-drunk what he wants He care about nothing else at all Nothing Not Pedersen's kid neither That cock Not the kid neither
get the spirits Ma said
wound Big Hans up tight I was ready to jump but when Ma said get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off Not any more Not for years The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where cut her with a boot cleat and maybe she saw him heaving it again the dirty sock popping out as it flew It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides
No you Big Hans said
Yes Hans if needed Ma said
Hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her If we had then one of us would have had to go instead Hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed
get more snow I said I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch I know where Ma went I thought gone upstairs and expected to hear she had She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said go and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat
Oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm He was awful angry because thought Ma was going to do something big something heroic even especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma thinking about that at all not anything like that There was no way of getting even It like getting cheated at the fair They were always trying so you got to expect it Now Hans had given Ma something of his we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa something valuable but since she know given it to her there was no easy way of getting it back
Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap He was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what done Ma had found one of Pa's hiding places found one and she said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one Pa had a knack for hiding He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it But now Ma found it by luck most likely but she said anything and we know how long ago been or how many other ones found saying nothing Pa was sure to find out Sometimes he seem to because he hid them so well he find them himself or because he looked and find anything and figured he hid one after all or had drunk it up But find out about this one because we were using it A fool could see what was going on If he found out Ma found it be bad He took pride in his hiding It was all the pride he had I guess fooling Hans and me took doing But he figure Ma for much He figure her at all and if he found out a woman be bad
Hans poured some in a tumbler
You going to put more towels on him
No
Why not what he needs something warm to his skin he
Not where froze good bad for frostbite why I only put towels on his chest and belly got to thaw slow You ought to know that
Colors on the towels had run
Ma poked her toe in the kid's clothes
What are we going to do with these
Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin
Here help me prop him up I got hold his mouth open
I want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and make any move to
Come on Jorge
All right
Lift shove lift
O.K. lifting
I took him by the shoulders His head flopped back His mouth fell open The skin on his neck was tight He was cold all right
Hold his head up choke
His mouth is open
His shut choke
choke anyway
Hold his head up
I
hold him like that Put your arms around him
Well Jesus
He was cold all right I put my arm carefully around him Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth
Now choke for sure
Shut up Just hold him like I told you
He was cold all right and wet I had my arm behind his back

He was in his mid-fifties at this time long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing There was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received it was always the same unqualified success now He could no longer build anything whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other values Stowey Rummel was internationally famous a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality He had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife a remarkably childish thing in itself he rose at half-past six every morning made himself some French coffee had his corn flakes and more coffee smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh Gazette then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop This was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor His files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form his models drawings ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house He worked standing with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person's hand Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved It all seemed if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's work This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine But he was not bored at all he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he should alter it There are after all fortunate souls who hear everything but only know how to listen to what is good for them and Stowey was as things go a fortunate man
He left his home the day after New Year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat He would wear this same costume in Florida despite his wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him But he was too busy to hear what she was saying So they parted when she was in an impatient humor When he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window Finding the key under his shoe he started the engine and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog and said Defrost the refrigerator
He saw the surprise in her face and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked and good humor an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it He would settle himself into his seat to laugh Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog mad as she was at his going away when he really have to mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by She was forty-nine at this time a lanky woman of breeding with an austere narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders There was an air of blindness in her gray eyes the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which besides has kept its estate intact She was personally sloppy and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it soaking wet dangling from her waist and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed brushed and taking breaths of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy a grace of history so to speak and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value She even spoke differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp
Now drive carefully for God's sake She called trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure But he did not notice and was already backing the car down to the road saying Toot-toot To the stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road Then when he had it pointed down the hill he stopped to gaze at her through the window She had begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell He looked at her out of himself she thought as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said Toot Once more and roared off into the fog his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked She walked back to the house and entered feeling herself returning sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building There is a death in all partings she knew and promptly put it out of her mind
She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially alone in her house was the realest part of life Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors she could dust the plants then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on improvise cha-chas on the harp and finally the best part of all simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers reading the ads as well as the news registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire She did this now comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon it was getting to be She fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things Stowey yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and nothing was burning on the stove and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes She stood up smoothing her hair down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of the need to answer to respond to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests She went into the living room and turned on three lamps then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn illuminating the driveway She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself They were both so young after all so unready for any final parting How could it have been thirty years already she wondered But yes nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen She stood still over the leg of lamb rubbing herbs into it quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath a sensation of violence that started her shivering

But they all said No your time will come Enjoy being a bride while you can
There was no room for company in the tiny Weaning House where the Albright boys always took their brides till they could get a house and a farm of their own So when the Big House filled up and ran over the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes And there was still not anything that Linda Kay could do
So Linda Kay gave up asking and accepted her reprieve Without saying so she was really grateful for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe's wife She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this People died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway at night
Bobby Joe was gone all day now not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper When they first married he had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal Now there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained and she did not know where he went Not that she complained or had any cause to Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age so naturally they ran around together There was no reason for her to ask what they did
Thus a new pattern of days began to develop for Granny Albright did not die She lay still on the bed her head hardly denting the pillow sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup They stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next day or two Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home for she might die any time but they might as well unpack their suitcases for she might linger on
So the pattern was established When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the Big House There was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was or would be Bobby Joe and the boys would come by say Granny And sit on the porch a while The older men would be there at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town
The women and children stayed at the Albrights' The women keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night The children had to play away from the house in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn to maintain a proper quietness
Off and on all day someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny's room and her door was kept shut so that the rest of the house stayed open though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way
The dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them so that the women were always making ice water They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there
One afternoon as the women sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gate It was a Cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled They were an old fat couple as Linda Kay described them to herself a thick middle-aged man and a girl about ten or twelve
There was much embracing much exclaiming Cousin Ada Cousin John Cousin Lura Cousin Howard And how is she About the same John about the same
All the women got up and offered their chairs and when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and their explanations
We were on our vacation in Canada Howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming and the news catch up with us till we were nearly home We came on as soon as we could
There was the suggestion of ice water and in spite of the protest not really thirsty Linda Kay to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices hurried to the kitchen
She filled a big pitcher and set it with glasses on a tray Carrying it to the living room she imagined the picture she made tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she entered the room
Howard the thick middle-aged man was looking at her She felt the look and looked back because she could not help it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed
And who is this He asked when she passed him a glass
Oh Linda Kay Mama Albright said fondly She married our baby boy Bobby Joe this summer
see Cousin Ada said a right smart younger than the rest
Oh yes Mama laughed ten years younger than Ernest We expect him to come along thought for the longest he was a tumor
This joke was not funny to Linda Kay and she blushed as she always did then hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter blushed redder
Who is Howard anyway She asked Bobby Joe that night He makes me uncomfortable
Oh a second cousin or something He got in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money
How old is he
Gosh I know Thirty-five I guess been married and got this half-grown kid If he bothers you pay him any mind just a big windbag Bobby Joe was thinking about something else Say did you know fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the Double J
He was talking about antelope again when they woke up Listen I never had a chance to kill an antelope There never was a season before but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth
Did he ever visit here when he was a kid Linda Kay asked
Who
Howard
Hell I know When he was a kid I around
Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door and with a quick Bye now was gone for the day
Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac
going after ice Howard said and thought maybe go along and keep us company
There was really no reason to refuse and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac
Driving along the caliche-topped road to town Howard talked Finally he said Tell me about yourself and Linda Kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life She was such a well-rounded teenager having been a twirler Future Farmers sweetheart and secretary of Future Homemakers In her sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe who was a football player Future Homemakers sweetheart and president of Future Farmers It was easy to see that they were made for each other and they knew what they wanted Bobby Joe would be a senior this year and he planned to graduate But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and blushing raise his children
Howard sighed You lucky kids he said give anything if I could have found a girl like you Then he told Linda Kay about himself Of course he say much really because of Debora but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got It made her feel different about Howard
She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they did was talk about antelope
Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home
Cook a whole antelope She exclaimed Why I even cook a piece of antelope steak I never even saw any
Oh you could I want to roast the whole thing and have it for the boys
Linda Kay told him he do anything like that with his Grandma dying and he said well they had to eat they they all dying Linda Kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry but they were going up to the Big House after supper and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little
Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright's and sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze It was full-of-the-moon or a little past and nearly light as day They all sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had a good time Once in a while they said what a shame it was with Granny dying but they all agreed she have wanted it any other way
That night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting and Uncle Bill Farnworth from Mama Albright's side of the family said he would just get up from there and take them right then
After they had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places to sit There were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall Howard who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting
be a darn sight more comfortable there Howard Ernest said laughing and they all laughed
Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable Bobby Joe had been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand from time to time but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before
Still she was not sorry he sat by her but in fact was flattered He had become the center of the company such stories he had to tell He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights

But tell me doctor where do you plan to conduct the hatching Alex asked
That will have to be in the hotel the doctor retorted confirming Alex's anticipations What I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel
The doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to initiate Alex further into these undertakings
The doctor opened the smallest of his cases an unimposing straw bag and exposed the contents for Alex's inspection Inside carefully packed in straw were six eggs but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs There was little enough time to contemplate them however in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands thoroughly eared and big as a table top He placed it on Alex's lap
This is my hen ledger he informed him in an absorbed way been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college That first entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all take them near a river though or squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving
The ledger was full of most precise information date of laying length of incubation period number of chick reaching the first week second week fifth week weight of hen size of rooster's wattles and so on all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen Below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed Alex's instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the Rue Ecole De Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all But after the doctor's return that night Alex could see from the high window in his own room the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen
A knocking at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning It was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste The doctor stood about waiting for Alex to dress with a show of impatience and soon they were moving as quietly as could be through the still-dark hallways past the bedroom of the patronne and so into the street The market was not far and once there the doctor's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention he quacked with the ducks and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery It was a fine broody hen white with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen The doctor with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope drew Alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him the fine color in comb and wattles the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles the firm wide spread of the toes and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets All search was ended he had found his fowl The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again the hen with whom some sort of communication had been set up nestling in the doctor's arms
The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who for all his care manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing
Bonjour messieurs vous etes matinals she greeted them pleasantly Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex's arm and back
Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors Their hostess enquired Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him The doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well Eyes swerved in the patronne's head Alex coughed loudly and the doctor with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps
Comment Ejaculated the surprised woman looking at Alex for an explanation but he parting from her without ceremony only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work With that he hurried up the stairs followed by her suspicious gaze
When Alex entered his room the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case six eggs ready for the hen's attentions There was no reference to the incident on the stairs his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business The hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them One part of her audience was totally engaged the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic the other part the guest of the connoisseur attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote the audience attended Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature Startled he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and Alex went to the door He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling coughing and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest It was Giselle the fille de chambre come to clean the room and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity explaining her errand Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again
Who was that young feller The doctor instantly asked
That was the fille de chambre the one you thought get the eggs out She looked mighty interested though Anyhow coming back in five minutes to do the room
The doctor's mind was working at a great speed he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice
Have you got our keys handy
Right in my pocket
All right Now you go outside and beckon me when safe The hall was empty and Alex beckoned they climbed the stairs which creaked very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next floor A guest was locking his room they passed behind him and got to Alex's room unnoticed The doctor sat down rather wearily caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes It was evident that a second transfer had to be effected and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began Alex's They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob but to no effect the lavatory was occupied Although a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat unwarranted they were in any case for as he stood facing the fille de chambre his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room The events of the last quarter of an hour mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails perhaps mourning her nest but briefly enjoyed The doctor's wits had not left him however for all his sixty-eight years and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out from the showerhead Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room Shortly the doctor himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures Without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside Next the hen was nested and all seemed well The two men sat for some time savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office
Alex returned to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an ebullient mood At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning
Chickens have short memories the doctor remarked why they are better company than most people I know and he went on to break some important news to Alex Well he began It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do got a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here with a wife for him too very rare birds both of them the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa Seems like willing but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then know what to do and the people at the zoo got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble

Going downstairs with the tray Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look There were times it right to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we keep peanut butter for a peanut butter sandwich You in this house he always told her Why Winston cry I just now saw you eating it out of the jar But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure
In the kitchen Leona his little young wife was reading the morning paper Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool
Here Winston said gently these dishes doing not washed The enormous plates which had held Mr. Jack's four fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink
Leave me alone Leona said you see busy She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper
This is moving day Winston reminded her and I bet you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made Leona His eye had fastened on her leg bending he touched her knee If I catch you one more time down here without stockings
She twitched her leg away Fuss fuss old man She had an alley cat's manners
Winston stacked Miss Ada's thin pink dishes in the sink Then he spread out the last list on the counter To Be Left Behind was printed at the top in Miss Ada fine hand Winston took out a pencil admired the point and wrote slowly and heavily Clothes Stand
Sighing Leona dropped the paper and stood up I guess I better get ready to go
Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron Here Carefully he undid the bow How come your bows is always cockeyed
She turned and put her arms around his neck I want to leave here Winston
Now listen to that He drew back embarrassed and pleased I thought you was sick to death of this big house Said you wore yourself out cleaning all these empty rooms
At least there is room here she said What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child
I told you what Miss Ada's doctor said
I mean Miss Ada What you think I care about that I mean our children She sounded as though they already existed
In spite of the hundred things he had on his mind Winston went and put his arm around her waist got plenty of time to think about that All the time in the world only been married four years January
Four years She wailed a long time waiting
How many times have I told you he began and was almost glad when she cut him off Too many times and flounced to the sink where she began noisily to wash her hands
Too many times was the truth of it Winston thought He hardly believed his reason himself any more Although it had seemed a good reason to begin with no couple could afford to have children
How you going to work with a child hanging on you He asked Leona You want to keep this job you He doubted whether she heard him over the running water
He sat for a while with his hands on his knees watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things a comb a bottle of aspirin to take upstairs and pack She made him sad some days and he was never sure why it was something to do with her back the thinness of it and the quick jerky way she bent She was too young that was all too young and thin and straight
Winston
It was Mr. Jack bellowing out in the hall Winston hurried through the swinging door been bursting my lungs for you Mr. Jack complained He was standing in front of the mirror tightening his tie He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat and his brief case lay on the bench I know what you think been doing about my clothes he said This coat looks like a rag heap
There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work He gave Mr. Jack a real going-over he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long firm strokes Hey Mr. Jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes
Winston apologized and quickly set the hat right Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack who was pulling on his pigskin gloves Winston enjoyed seeing him start out he wore his clothes with style When he was going to town nothing was good enough he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace At home he even wash his hands for supper and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys The velvet smoking jackets pearl-gray wine and blue which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet
Good-by Winston Mr. Jack said giving a final set to his hat Look out for those movers Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car a handsome fine-looking man it made him proud to see
After Mr. Jack drove away Winston went on looking out the window He noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger Then he looked at his finger at the wrinkled heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up slit and open For the first time he be sad about the move That house was ten years off his life let himself Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier He knew the house like a blind man through his fingers and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up
Ten years ago he had come to the house to be interviewed The tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive and he had walked up from the bus almost singing Miss Ada had been out back in a straw hat planting flowers She had talked to him right there with the hot sun in his face which made him sweat and feel ashamed Winston had been surprised at her for that Still he had liked the way she had looked in a fresh neat cotton dress citron yellow if he remembered She had had a dignity about her even barefoot and almost too tan
Since then the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate and the periwinkles were coming on blue by the porch steps In a week the hyacinths would spike out And the dogwood in early May for Miss Ada's alfresco party and after that the Japanese cherries Now the yard looked wet and bald the trees bare under their buds but in a while Miss Ada's flowers would bloom like a marching parade She had dug a hole for each bulb each tree wore a tag with her writing on it where would she go for her gardening now Somehow Winston think take to window boxes
Sighing he hurried to the living room He had a thousand things to see to Still he help thinking all getting old getting small the snail is pulling in her horns
In the living room Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand She was looking out at the garden
Winston she said get the basket for the breakables
Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall He brought it in and put it down beside her Miss Ada was looking fine she had on her Easter suit blue with lavender binding Halfway across the house he could have smelled her morning perfume It hung in all her day clothes sweet and strong sometimes when he was pressing Winston raised her dresses to his face
Frowning Miss Ada studied the list Well see The china lemon tree The alabaster cockatoo Winston followed her around the room collecting the small frail objects Christmas birthday and anniversary and wrapping them in tissue paper Neither of them trusted the movers
When they came to Mr. Jack's photograph twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame Miss Ada said By rights I ought to leave that seeing he take my clotheshorse She smiled at Winston and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes He picked up the photograph and began to wrap it
At least you could leave it for the movers Miss Ada said What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea
Winston folded the tissue paper carefully used it every day every morning I lay out his clothes on it
Well over now And it was his main present Leave that fool picture out she added sharply
Winston laid it in the basket Mr. Jack sets store by that
Really Winston It was meant to be my present But she went on down the list
Winston was relieved those presents had been on his mind He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack You know what she likes Winston he had said wearily one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his overshoes Tell me what to get her for Christmas
been talking about a picture Winston had told him
Picture You mean picture of me But Winston had persuaded him
On Christmas night they had had a disagreement about it Winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room Through the door he had seen Mr. Jack walking around waiting for Miss Ada Finally she had come down Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown
How do you like it She had asked
Mr. Jack had said You look about fifteen years old
Is that a compliment
I know He had stood at a little distance studying her as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head
Lovie you make me feel naked Miss Ada had giggled and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down
You look like that picture I have at the office Mr. Jack had started Not a line not a wrinkle I look like an old man compared and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it Look an old man Will you wear pink when sixty
Darling I love that photograph going to put it on my dresser
I guess children make a woman old A man gets old anyhow After a minute he went on People must think the curse is on me seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray
give you a medical certificate framed if you like Miss Ada had said
No All I want is a picture with a few lines Make the man put them in if he has to
After that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word Then Miss Ada had stood up rustling and rustling and gone upstairs

Was it love I had no doubt that it was During the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight
Nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world In final separation from them in the railroad terminal across the river from New York I would nearly cry My parents' welcoming arms would seem woeful inadequate unwanted But that year was different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had intruded upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall Jessica and I about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs had agreed to correspond
These letters became the center of my existence I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer My memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink scented stationery and the unsloped almost printed configurations of her neat studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer so many sentences beginning with Remember when and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood and news of her commencing again her piano lessons her private school a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough wounded from the war in Europe
In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques full of dash and wit and glamor quoting from the books I read imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special after-school class I was enrolled The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands he of the porch steps anecdotes who smoked cigarettes performed the tango wore fifty dollar suits and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them Like Eliot in my fantasies I had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely continental I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses burning with love The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle it must have been late in September I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front nearly dying my head bandaged and blooded and Jessica bending over me the power of her love bringing me back to life For many nights afterward the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie awake in shame tossing with irresolution longing to fall into a deep sleep
The weeks went by and the longer our separation grew the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again
As it turned out Jessica took matters into her own hands Having received permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party she asked that I come and be her date I went and mum and nervous all but made a fool of myself Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance I remember standing in a corner watching Jessica act the hostess serving soft drinks to her guests She was wearing her dark hair in two thick braids to attain an American Girl effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish I was excited to be with her but I did not know how to express it Yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages out of my mind and plant himself in reality It was late we were playing kissing games and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others We blushed and were flustered and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting premonitions of lust all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me
It was at that party that finally overcoming my timidity inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys I asked Jessie to spend New Year's Eve with me Lovingly she accepted and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was amazing you know Later we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night We would write to one another and make a definite plan She was terribly pleased
Among my school and neighborhood friends during the next months I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date But though I boasted and gave off a dapper front I was beneath it all frightened It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved I had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl or how one behaved Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street Should I bring along a corsage or send one to her Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city Should I accompany her to the door of her home or should I ask to be invited in In or out should I kiss her goodnight All this was unknown to me and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year
When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year's Eve I knew for a moment an immense relief but the letter went on she had cried she had implored she had been miserable at his refusal and finally he had relented and now how happy she was how expectant
Her optimism gave me heart I forced confidence into myself I made inquiries I read a book of etiquette In December I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel Astor a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated We would attend a film and later on I stated we might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop or Child's or Toffenetti's for waffles I set the hour of our meeting for seven
At five o'clock that night it was already dark and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil's ears My camp-made leather wallet bulky with twisted raised stitches around the edges I stuffed with money I had been saving Hatless in an overcoat of rough blue wool I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and I set out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind felt older than my years and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable tantalizing excitement of Manhattan
Times Square when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members was nearly impassable the sidewalks swarming with celebrants with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey Heavy-coated severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic The night was cold but the crowd kept one warm The giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner Cardboard noisemakers substitutes for the unavailable tin models were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway and one's ears were continually serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats An old gentlemen next to me held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out V for Victory His neighbors cheered him on There was a great sense of camaraderie How did one join them Where were they all walking to Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica
It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking I looked over their faces and felt a twinge they all looked so much more knowing than I I looked away I looked for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging curdling crowd and as the time passed and I waited a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear How was I planning to greet Jessica Where exactly would we go after the movie Suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we get in Suppose I brought along enough money I felt for my wallet Its thick substantial outline calmed me
But when I saw that it was already ten past seven I began to wonder if something had gone wrong Suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave Suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans I grew uneasy All about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place like abrupt jerky scenes in old silent movies joyous greetings and beginnings huggings and kissings enthusiastic forays into the festive night Whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps arriving and departing while I stayed glued like a signpost to one spot
At 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground their golden fringed epaulets and spic red-visored caps I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd My heart almost stopped beating
