In most of the less developed countries however such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent Only a very few of the more advanced ones such as India and Pakistan have developed systematic techniques of programing
Others have so-called development plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation We can help in the planning process Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country it must express the nation's own will and goal Nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing
First we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs
Second we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program
Third we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources This includes assistance in assembling the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depends surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication industry and power designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established We must use common sense in applying conditions The application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds of course be mechanical It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions To insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth
In the more primitive areas where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available Thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs In such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress being made
At the other end of the spectrum where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support in cooperation with other developed countries of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program
D Encouraging self-help 1 The reasons for stressing self-help A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help There are many others It is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves External aid can only be marginal although the margin as in the case of the Marshall plan can be decisive External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help U.S. aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take Aid advice is not interference In establishing conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image Open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals On the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur 2 The range of self-help The major areas of self-help are the following A the effective mobilizing of resources
This includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few B the reduction of dependence on external sources
This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed C tapping the energies of the entire population
For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country Otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability D honesty in government
In many societies what we regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly Yet an economy get the most out of its resources if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread Moreover tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest Some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification correct or not of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential in the long run 3 U.S. position on self-help The United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in self-help
In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts
There are other countries where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth Governments are rarely monolithic
But there will be still other countries where despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination
E Encouraging a long-term approach 1 Development requires a long-term approach The most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention our resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries This is not a short-run goal To have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion Most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country In several significant cases such as India a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance These cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance Gradually others will move up to the same level The number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world Meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible Aid is a long-term process The whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted 2 The specific reasons for a long-term approach A the need to budget a period of years
Many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods Dams river development schemes transportation networks educational systems require years to construct Moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence Thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year The capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs B the need to plan investment programs
More importantly several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence Without such forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed C the need to allocate country resources
Most important of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources They must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policies They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section The taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions Moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt They must therefore be related to long-range development plans 3 Providing an incentive If the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the United States as the principal supplier of external aid must be prepared to give long-term commitments In this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them If they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments

You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people
So I say Mr. Speaker God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world You remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago when someone asked him when he was in Canada and Dean Rusk was in Europe and Vice President Johnson was in Asia Who is running the store And he said The same fellow who has been running it Sam Rayburn
General leave to extend Mr. McCormack
Mr. Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks The speaker pro tempore
Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts
There was no objection
Remarks of Hon. Joseph P. Addabbo of New York Mr. Addabbo
It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker the Honorable Sam Rayburn I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas I did so because I agree with so many here today that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United States For the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our Government it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country To honor him is to honor ourselves
In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced many memorable moments Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me And like many of you here present I hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable Speaker of the House At that time he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national and local topics and any problems that I may have been vexed with at the time He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel In conclusion he wished me well and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children
In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle He is most effective in the ordinary business of the House and in the legislative accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle and as the Nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan
I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant He will ever be my example as a true statesman one who is thoroughly human who affects no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long May the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn's continued service here for years to come
Remarks of Hon. Wayne L. Hays of Ohio Mr. Hays
It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise respect and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn In this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength He has become in this half century the grand old man of American history It seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam Rayburn's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades
Here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions Sam Rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this Nation It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district and my State What Sam Rayburn's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one's own community one's own district one's own State and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time
For Sam Rayburn never forgot Bonham his home community and he never forgot Texas In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community our district our State And if we follow the Rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district There is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs The two are as one This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson Sam Rayburn's career up to this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government
More than that Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition Through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility Sam Rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions This means much to the American tradition It is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics And the name Rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century
It is I insist hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep But this we know Here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor decency and self-respect I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose
Remarks of Hon. Melvin Price of Illinois Mr. Price
All but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam Rayburn Of this I am proud I have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness
And Sam Rayburn is a great man one who will go down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation He will be considered not only great among his contemporaries but as great among all the Americans who have played a part in the country's history since the beginning
I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn stalwart Texan and great American not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress
Speaker Rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker's chair He had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913 the 63d Congress No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn He is the recognized father of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission But to run the gauntlet of the programs Sam Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today's Record
No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker this great legislator this great Texan this great American
My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today
Remarks of Hon. John S. Monagan of Connecticut Mr. Monagan
Sam Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing Sam Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States
Others may speak of Speaker Rayburn's uniquely long and devoted service of his championship of many of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute books today and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy international seas
I prefer to speak however of Sam Rayburn the person rather than Sam Rayburn the American institution
Although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition No one could be more devoted than he to the American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world and I shall never forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today's assault upon popular government
Above all he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman In this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic and most helpful
On September 16 Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date and in expressing my esteem for that notable American Sam Rayburn

Origin of state automobile practices
The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917
The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940
The automobile maintenance unit or motor pool came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time
The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle operation Cars were operated in 1959 for an average $.027 per mile
Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes Vehicle purchase assignment and use policies
The legislature's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles
The meaningful policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state's administrative officers
Meaningful policies include A kinds of cars the state should own B when cars should be traded C the need and assignment of vehicles D use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances E employees taking cars home and F need for liability insurance on state automobiles
A review of these policies indicates 1 The state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle 2 The purchase of compact economy cars is being made currently on a test basis 3 Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy 4 The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances 5 Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles 6 It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes 7 The state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars Automobile practices in other states
A survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices
Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business Two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval
States which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool
Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles
Nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances Of these states the average change-over point at which a car is substituted for allowances is 13,200 miles per year Mileage allowances
Mileage allowances for state employees are of two types A actual mileage and B fixed monthly allowances
Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of $.07 per mile Fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis Both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations
Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of $.07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states' rates The average of states' rates is $.076 per mile
Rhode Island's rate of $.07 per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $.09 per mile average
Actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state The travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive
Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment However they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures Flat payments over $50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles Travel allowances
Travel allowances including subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states' allowances With few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $15 per day subsistence Travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control
Origin of state automobile practices general background
It is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode Island Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 Those that are available shed little light The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917 It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old
The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and '30s At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable
Once the principle was established the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself It does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them History and operation of the motor pool
While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly Prior to 1942 automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned This responsibility included all phases of management It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who was to drive when and where repairs were to be made where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters In 1942 however the nation was at war Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more popularly called the motor pool a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation The motor pool then as now had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner
Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% the total maintenance cost increased only 11%
In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles on July 1 1958 the actual title to every vehicle was transferred by Executive Order to the Division of Methods Research and Office Services The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles Note So far as State Police cars are concerned only their replacement is under this division This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs in light of depreciation become excessive Moreover it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet for example if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years rather than 44,000 miles and related higher maintenance costs and 16,000 miles respectively
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation It handles all types of vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities than on extensive vehicle repairs It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded for sound economies From this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data In 1959-60 vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random
One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more Purchasing practices
The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public The reasons are obvious 1 the state is buying in quantity and 2 it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers
In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later
Vehicle purchase assignment and use policies Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles The legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state the Director of Administration

The Rhode Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax This tax was discontinued in 1936
Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well Thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at the rates then existing insufficient for their requirements
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level
Notwithstanding state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored
Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a hands off nature due possibly to several reasons 1 local assessors in the main are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs 2 the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult and 3 the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property Problems of taxing personal property
Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant 1 situs 2 fair and equitable assessment of value These problems are not local to Rhode Island but are recognized as common to all states Situs of property
Although the laws of the various states in general specify the situs of property i.e. residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc. seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment
Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated It also provides for the taxation of all personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state In defining personal property it specifically mentions all ships or vessels at home or abroad
Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property and all other tangible property situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31
Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged Obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft
A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes on December 31 1960 from the Newport Airpark in Middletown to the North Central Airport in Smithfield This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve 12 months next preceding the first day of April in each year
The Smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated Assessment of value
This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem This accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island
This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented
The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units
The Institute of Public Administration in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job The resulting setup it was declared would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island Practices in Rhode Island
To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island
The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case There are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time
In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not The wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations One assessor checked boats only another trailers and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type In two cases airplanes only were indicated
It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats It would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property
So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind
Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership Fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen did not answer
Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property and only five were opposed Seven others expressed no opinion On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now It is not clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns
Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner Eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides Ten others made no reply Of those who have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred There was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date
To summarize it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies
Boats as personal property taxing of boats
Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting
It has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach Through their professional organization the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed No satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors
It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats It is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation
It is known that at least five towns Barrington Bristol Narragansett Newport and Westerly place some value on some boats for tax purposes However few are taxed and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations
No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close
The assessors' association meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem

Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960's industrial development effort Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000 a new post-World War 2 record With minor exceptions this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs
Of the major expansions in 1960 three were financed under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed mortgage plan Collyer Wire Leesona Corporation and American Tube & Controls Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation Cornell-Dubilier Photek Inc. Division of Textron Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry W. R. Cobb Company and Mays Manufacturing Company
Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council's Industrial Division and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation Industrial Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island concerns during 1960 many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location They are conscious of this state's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island Aids to small business Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries small business is also afforded considerable attention Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous program directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories
A primary function is the operation of a Government Bid Center which receives bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations where to obtain specifications and follow-ups concerning qualification During the past year 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers
In addition the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses how and where to apply for financial assistance details on marketing information concerning patents copyrights and trade marks availability of technical reports and other subjects of interest to small business
The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade assisting Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad This office cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include statistics on markets abroad locating foreign agents buyers distributors etc. information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations licensing investments and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment
During the year 1960 this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce and made 73 field visits Advertising program Our media advertising continued during 1960 its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100% financing plant availabilities and location advantages We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here
To reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000 and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 to $20,000
Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal Eastern and Midwestern editions which averaged two prominent ads per month and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and for the west coast the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal Pacific Coast edition In addition to the regular schedule advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times Boston Herald American Banker Electronic News and for local promotion the Providence Sunday Journal Magazine advertising included Management Methods The New Englander U. S. Investor and Plant Location
The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics plastics pharmaceutical and business machine manufacturers and to publishers These totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence
The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries 164 from media and 75 from direct mail Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries New York led in the number of inquiries followed by California New Jersey Massachusetts and Pennsylvania Among foreign countries responding were Germany Canada Brazil and India Industrial promotion An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term Missionary calls by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists These consist of visits without previous announcement on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas More than 25 carefully selected cities were visited including New York Brooklyn Long Island City Newark Elizabeth Stamford Waterbury New Haven Bridgeport Boston Cambridge Worcester and Waltham
Out of a total of 603 calls 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel We received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits Industrial conferences During 1960 two important conferences were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division In June the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce in conjunction with local trade associations chambers of commerce and bank officials sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959 Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I. Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event
On October 8th of last year the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School A comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals
Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce Richard Preston executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission and Edwin C. Kepler of General Electric Company Workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania Connecticut and Maine and rounded out a rewarding program
In connection with this conference a 64-page supplement was published in the October 2nd edition of The Providence Sunday Journal Devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients Mailings and publications Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors 1184 copies of the R. I. Directory Of Manufacturers were distributed 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state
The Industrial Division published in 1960 a new attractive industrial brochure Rhode Island Right For Industry and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers to be printed shortly and for a new space catalogue
Additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey the new automated post office and a conference with representatives of Brown University Providence College and University of Rhode Island and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel
Planning division Stated in its simplest terms the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning
Two years ago the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled State-Local Relations In Metropolitan Rhode Island As the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report plus an analysis of our own enabling act the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division 1 First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state 2 Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that Metropolian Planning in Rhode Island means or should mean state planning the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems 3 It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government To this end the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff 4 The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government among the operating departments of the state between the cities and towns of the state and on a regional basis between the six New England states 5 On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources plans for the provision of essential services such as water will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within the framework of the state plan 6 The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan 7 In preparing the state guide plan particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation
Functionally the planning division carries out four activities long-range state planning current state planning local planning assistance and the preparation of the state development budget Long-range state planning The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation The long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases basic mapping inventory analysis and plan and policy formation The work program as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete Recent events particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 1961 Basic mapping Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet covering the entire state With these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started Inventory With the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended the planning division began a one year program July 1 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program This phase consists of four items urban land use rural land use physical features and public utility service areas Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible
The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning The rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion July 1 1961 Analysis The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose

Special districts in Rhode island
It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island However a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government
There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island excluding two regional school districts four housing authorities and the Kent County Water Authority These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued and in general to exercise normal corporate powers Unlike cities and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government In addition to the collection of service charges the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000
Fiscal years in other states comparative data
A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report Included in the findings are 1
Forty-six states including Rhode Island end their fiscal year on June 30 The other four states end on varying dates Alabama Sept. 30 New York March 31 Pennsylvania May 31 and Texas August 31 2
In sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the cities June 30 is the same as that of the state Alaska Arizona California Delaware Massachusetts Montana Nevada New Mexico North Carolina North Dakota Oklahoma Oregon Vermont West Virginia Wyoming and Hawaii 3
In eleven states the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 Arkansas Colorado Indiana Kansas New Hampshire New Jersey Ohio South Dakota Utah Washington and Wisconsin 4
In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 Georgia Iowa Kentucky Maine Maryland Minnesota Virginia and South Carolina 5
One state Alabama closes its fiscal year on September 30 and all cities in the state with one exception also close fiscal years on September 30 6
Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30 7
Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31 All of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31
The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments However only Illinois Oregon Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity
Fiscal uniformity advantages and disadvantages advantages
An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity 1
The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending 2
The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts 3
The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures 4
The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest share of local disbursements This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting 5
The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes Furthermore tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy 6
The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons and as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare
Of all advantages probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times It may be by bank loans sale of notes or warrants or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants In any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security
It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year Both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1 Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below
It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions this is no longer true The haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships Disadvantages
Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island there are also certain difficulties encountered These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle One problem is a matter of shifting dates the other is how to finance the transition
Little can be done about the changing of dates This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem
The other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns This will be covered more fully later It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city Fortunately there are no cities or towns in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely
Adjusting the fiscal calendars The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed Two features are immediately evident First the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula Second the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns There are at least two problems to consider one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section
Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar Plans vary from the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish this end What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them
An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought However it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved
The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island based on a July 1 to June 30 year are shown below No adjustment needed
Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it No change is required for these towns These municipalities include Barrington Lincoln Middletown Newport North Kingstown and South Kingstown Adjustment of fiscal year
One town and one city Coventry and East Providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year Adjustment of tax collection year
Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity These cities and towns include Bristol Glocester Pawtucket Cumberland Central Falls and Woonsocket Simultaneous adjustments
Two cities to be considered Providence and Cranston are an enigma Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars However neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year
The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them In that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30 These three installment dates would be October 26 January 26 and April 25 Providence and November 15 February 16 and May 15 Cranston Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 Their tax collection calendar could then be July 25 October 26 January 26 and April 25 Providence and August 15 November 15 February 17 and May 15 Cranston Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods Varying adjustments
The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30 All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3
Methods of financing adjustments Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements In many communities there is simply no financial problem it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes Fortunately such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule
As shown earlier in Table 1 the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars In addition no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length of the transition interval Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds
The financial problem where it exists usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem

Proclamation Thanksgiving Day by John A. Notte Jr. Governor As another Thanksgiving draws near let us take time out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving
The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during their first year in the new land They had been through trying times but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude they shared another feeling the anticipation of what the future held for them and their posterity They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world They simply turned to God filled with gratitude and faith
We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that God's Providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country And yet accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time With world peace constantly being threatened most of us regard the future skeptically and even with fear It is at this time that we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for the Lord's protection in the future if we are to have peace now therefore do I John A. Notte Jr. governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations proclaim Thursday November 23rd 1961 as Thanksgiving Day
And so let us remember on this day not only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage to the Pilgrims but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue to protect us in the future as He has in the past
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of November in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence the one hundred and eighty-sixth John A. Notte Jr.

Six fascicles 10,000 copies each of the Atlas Of Tumor Pathology were completed during the period of this report The American Registry Of Pathology This consists of 25 individual registries two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 The Registry Of Forensic Pathology and The Testicular Tumor Registry These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical dental and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of military-medical importance The American Registry Of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National Research Council and The Surgeons General of the Army Navy and Air Force The staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings exhibits and published studies During the period of this report 37,470 new cases were entered into the various registries These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes
In this same period six new fascicles of the Atlas Of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers world-wide There were 54,320 copies of fascicles sold and 642 copies distributed free during this period Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic Conferences were prepared bringing the total to 61 available for loan distribution Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic Conference sets were prepared which makes a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan During this period 7,827 teaching sets were distributed on loan The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military hospitals The demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes The Medical Museum In fiscal year 1959 the Medical Museum was moved to Chase Hall a temporary building on Independence Avenue at Ninth Street Southwest and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical Services During the period of this report 63 panel exhibits depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed Of the 375 exhibits of all types shown 161 were new or refurbished Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished 254 were prepared for other agencies Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study purposes An exhibit Macropathology An Ancient Art A New Science was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association
A three-dimensional exhibit depicting A Century Of Naval Medicine was formally presented to The Director by George S. Squibb great-grandson of the founder of E. R. Squibb and Sons for permanent display in the Museum
Space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits and the Museum collected new accessions of microscopes medical surgical and diagnostic instruments uniform and similar items of historical medico-military significance
During the period the laboratory rendered centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters Specimens were mounted for military installations governmental agencies and medical schools
Three hundred five copies of the Manual Of Macropathological Techniques were distributed Thirty-five military and civilian students received laboratory training
During fiscal years 1959 and 1960 there were 795,586 visitors to the Museum
During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 the Medical Museum was required to move to Temporary Building S on the Mall from Chase Hall Throughout the period and during the movement operation the Museum continued its functional support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency established in 1949 has published since January 1950 The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services Its supplement The Medical Technicians Bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin published continuously from 1907 through 1959 as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department published from 1922 to 1949 In addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin Estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service were between $65,000 and $70,000 Additionally on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage
From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published Each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest and departments devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features of interest to officers of the medical services The Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled This Is Your A.M.A.
Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting This resulted in an improved appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds
Two special issues were published one for November 1959 on Space Medicine the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960 The February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled The Medical Officer Writes Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue a section called Technical Notes was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue Occasional features were published on historical medicine special reports bibliography and Collector's Items In May 1960 the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the Medical Museum and in June the Institute started contributing a regular monthly Case For Diagnosis The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles beginning in the fall of 1960 on its more significant Scientific Exhibits
The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal

Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride
The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion In one of these an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Af and 100 atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element
A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion The shutter consists of two parts a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part Using Edgerton's method the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil approximately Af placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera The opening action is obtained when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through the foil During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra
Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms ions and small molecules The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH SiH and Aj Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable in interstellar gas concentrations as low as Af molecules per Af may be sufficient as compared to the Af hydrogen atom's Af required for detection of the 21-cm line
High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible To secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead This involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity
The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 Af with an uncertainty of 0.10 Af Success in observing these spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals Low temperature thermometry
The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurements see p. 144 Acoustical interferometer
An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used with helium gas as the thermometric fluid to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 Af Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found This result is preliminary and work is continuing Resistance thermometers
Carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 Af at every 0.1 Af The estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree and for the third resistor 3.3 millidegrees Vapor pressure method
The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 Af Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 Af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium However the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface It has also been observed in helium 2 that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow Pressure transducer for pvt measurements
Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested The transducer is a null-type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in. apart for Af Spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm an overload of 300 psi applied for a period of one day results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter of mercury Transport properties of air
A 6-year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed This project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command U.S. Air Force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present The results of the study based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density International cooperative activities
In March 1961 representatives of the national laboratories of Australia Canada The Netherlands United Kingdom U.S.S.R. United States and West Germany met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 Af As a first step toward this goal arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the Aj These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory Temperature symposium
During the last week of march 1961 Columbus Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry The Symposium which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics the Instrument Society of America and the National Bureau of Standards attracted nearly one thousand registrants including many from abroad The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack General Chairman and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld Program Chairman Dr. A. V. Astin NBS Director opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories
2.1.6 Atomic physics In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards spectroscopy solid state physics interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation Two data centers have been established for the collection indexing critical evaluation and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross sections Laboratory astrophysics
Transition probabilities
Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities An exhaustive survey was made of the literature and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation
A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent
A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39,000 lines of 70 elements as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc was completed and published Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities These data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas Atomic energy levels
Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare earth elements New computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success

Mr. Dooley
Mr. Speaker for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex high taxes losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers to name but two And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service
There have been a number of sound plans proposed But none of these has been implemented Instead we have stood idly by watched our commuter railroad service decline and have failed to offer a helping hand Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957 Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area Here the New York Central Railroad one of the Nation's most important carriers has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949
At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads
The New York Central has pointed out that this control if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission would give the combined C. & O. B. & O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area
The New York Central notes
The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. & O. B. & O. provides the backbone of Central's revenues These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services If these services are to be maintained the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible
The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City This is a $14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively A blow to this phase of the Central's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city
There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. & O. B. & O. merger scheme
The Central has pointed out
The logic of creating a strong balanced competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. & O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here
Detailed studies of the plan were well underway Though far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned their investors their customers their users and to the public at large
Then abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned B. & O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation
In the light of the facts at hand however New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest
The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. & O. B. & O. merger on June 18 Obviously the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge
However there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss That is will it serve the long-range public interest
For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter the two-way B. & O. C. & O. merger or the three-way New York Central B. & O. C. & O. merger Which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests of all the traveling public Mr. Lindsay
Mr. Speaker I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper the New York Times on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command
Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times
Mr. Sulzberger's successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos who is president of the New York Times Co. and who has been with the Times since 1942 Mr. Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained
I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes a member of the Times staff since 1946 has been appointed as editorial page editor Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles Merz editor since 1938 who now becomes editor emeritus
I should like at this time Mr. Speaker to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism
My heartiest congratulations go to their successors Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times
The people of the 17th District of New York and I as their Representative in Congress take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world Mr. Stratton
Mr. Speaker in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine Yesterday I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its disadvantages
Under leave to extend my remarks I include the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report your Congressman Samuel S. Stratton reports from Washington May 1 1961 Cuban S.S.R. Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week there was at least one positive benefit and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base
In fact one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment Somehow the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States violate the Monroe Doctrine and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic
Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this even if we had to go it alone But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative from secret military talks But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week You can see it for example in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos efforts as I see it which are being directed by the way toward support for future actions not for those already past
What the next move will be only time of course will tell Personally I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba We simply tolerate further Russian weapons including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles being located in Cuba Obviously we stop them from coming in however just by talk A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine would be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere
from U.s. News & World Report May 8 1961 next for Cuba an arms blockade
Look at Castro now cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas
How can the United States act
Blockade is one answer offered by experts In it they see a way to isolate Cuba stop infiltration maybe finish Castro too
This is the question now facing President Kennedy How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere
On April 25 the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered Its aim To undermine further Cuba's economy Weaken Castro
Another strategy bolder and tougher was also attracting notice in Washington a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world destroy Castro
Blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro It could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America It would be the most severe reprisal short of declared war that the United States could invoke against Castro
It is the strategy of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials Members of Congress officers in the Pentagon As a possible course of action it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions Among these questions what would a Cuba blockade take
Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers
The Navy on April 25 announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's sailing time away
To round out the blockading force submarines would be needed to locate identify and track approaching vessels Land-based radar would help with this task So would radar picket ships A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces
Three requirements go with a blockade It must be proclaimed the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it and it must be enforced without discrimination
Once these conditions of international law are met countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk Blockade runners can be stopped by gunfire if necessary searched and held at least temporarily They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated What could a blockade accomplish
Plenty say the experts In a broad sense it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere It could by avoiding direct intervention provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration
Primary target would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband In a total blockade action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals oils textiles and even foodstuffs At times three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports

From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 66th Congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States by means of grants-in-aid to return disabled men and women to productive gainful employment The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 of the Social Security Act in 1935 Up to this time and for the next eight years the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling and placement on a job Recognizing the limitations of such a program the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113 which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised the financing structure Recent changes
Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled To assist the States therefore in rehabilitating handicapped individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 P. L. 565 These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities for more sheltered and half-way workshops for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive services to individuals particularly to the homebound and the blind and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness Financial aspects
Under the law as it existed until 1943 the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis Under P. L. 113 78th Congress the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services Throughout these years the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act
The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program providing for a three-part grant structure for 1 basic support 2 extension and improvement and 3 research demonstrations training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation and in addition for short-term training and instruction The first part of the new structure that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services is described in this Section Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure
The following table shows for selected years the authorizations appropriations allotment base Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program
method of distributing funds description of formula
In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on 1 need as measured by a State's population and 2 fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita income The Act further provides for a floor or minimum allotment set at the 1954 level which is called the base allotment and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each State It stipulates in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the ceiling and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed to those States still below their maximums These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone Method of computing allotments
The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act The term State means the several States the District of Columbia the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico the term United States includes the several States and the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii The following steps are employed in calculations 1
For each State except Puerto Rico Guam the Virgin Islands and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii determine average per capita income based on the last three years See Source of Data below for per capita income data to be used in this step 2
Determine the average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years See Source of Data below for per capita income data to be used in this step 3
Determine the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above 4
Determine for each State except the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S. Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above 5
Determine the particular State's allotment percentage By law this is 75% for the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more than 75% If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes the State's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme 6
Square each State's allotment percentage 7
Determine each State's population See Source of Data below for population data to be used in this step 8
Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage Multiply result obtained in item 7 above by result obtained in item 6 above 9
Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above for all the States For each State make all computations set forth in items 1 to 8 above and then add the results obtained for each State in item 8 10
Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States Divide the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above 11
Determine the particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above 12
Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment result obtained in item 11 above is greater than its maximum allotment and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment Each State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000 must be reduced by the amount of the excess 13
Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment result obtained in item 11 above is less than its minimum base allotment and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment Regardless of its unadjusted allotment each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000 14
The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used first to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment item 13 above and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum Additional note on allotments
For the States which maintain two separate agencies one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind the Act specifies that their minimum base allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 Funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine
Matching requirements explanation of matching formula
As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula Prior to 1960 in order to provide matching for the minimum base allotment State funds had to equal 1954 State funds Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State with a pivot of 40% State or 60% Federal participation in total program costs The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State's Federal share For purposes of this explanation this percentage is referred to as the State's unadjusted Federal share Beginning in 1960 the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted upward or downward as required 25% a year so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State share with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30% respectively The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect to any State's base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 1962 period is designated by the statute as that State's adjusted Federal Share The provisions for determining a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States The purpose of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates Method of computing Federal shares
The method used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act The term State means the several States the District of Columbia the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico the term United States includes the several States and the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii The following steps are employed in the calculations 1
For each State except the Virgin Islands Guam Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii determine the average per capita income for the last three years the same amount used in item 1 under Method Of Computing Allotments above 2
Determine the average per capita income for the United States for the last three years The same amount used in item 2 under Method Of Computing Allotments above 3
Determine the ratio of 40% to the average per capita income of the United States Divide 40 by the amount used in item 2 above 4
Determine for each State except the Virgin Islands Guam Puerto Rico and prior to 1962 Alaska and Hawaii that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the United States Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above 5
Determine the particular State's Federal Share By law this is 70% for the Virgin Islands Guam and Puerto Rico Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above except that no State shall have a Federal share less than 50% nor more than 70% If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes the State's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme

At the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall The outside 4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall Mortar is poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding For details see inset fig. 5
The first one or two roof boards marked E in fig. 6 are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside the shelter These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together
Work on the roof continues in this way The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter
When the roof blocks are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position The structure is complete See fig. 7 Building plans are on page 21
Solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense are used for this shelter These blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit
Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection
Bricks are an alternative If they are used the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks
The illustrations in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall More detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen Other sources of information include the National Concrete Masonry Association 38 South Dearborn Street Chicago Ill. the Portland Cement Association 33 West Grand Avenue Chicago Ill. and the Structural Clay Products Association Washington D.C. Aboveground double-wall shelter An outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks See fig. 9 double-wall shelter Most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter Plans are on pages 22 and 23
This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground shelter
Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart The space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built
The roof shown here fig. 9 is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete covered with at least 20 inches of pit-run gravel An alternate roof perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel
The materials for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700 Contractors' charges would be additional The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection Pre-shaped metal shelter Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface They form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure 10
Materials for this shelter would cost about $700 A contractor probably would be required to help build it His charges would be added to the cost of materials This shelter as shown on page 24 would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation An alternate hatchway entrance shown on page 25 would reduce the cost of materials $50 to $100
The National Lumber Manufacturers Association Washington D. C. is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction The Structural Clay Products Institute Washington D.C. is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction Underground concrete shelter An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500 depending on the type of entrance The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection
The illustration fig. 11 shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over The same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level Plans for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown on pages 26 and 27
Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction It would add about $500 to the total cost of the home The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington D.C. area in the Spring of 1959
Important considerations common to each type of shelter are 1
Arrangement of the entrance 2
Ventilation 3
Radio reception 4
Lighting
The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn Radiation scatters somewhat like light Some will go around a corner The rest continues in a straight line Therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter
Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance A blower may be installed to increase comfort
A blower is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters It should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person Vent pipes also are necessary as shown in figs. 9 10 and 11 but filters are not
Radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts
Lighting is an important consideration Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb Tests have shown that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days With a spare battery a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas
Other considerations If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix page 29 Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix page 29
In these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide Bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed
The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection
3 Living in a shelter The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous
Therefore civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed A battery-powered radio is essential Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation There is a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available One instrument thus would serve both purposes
Your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources It will tell you as soon as possible
How long to stay in your shelter
How soon you may go outdoors
How long you may stay outside
You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer A checklist in the Appendix page 30 tells what is needed Families with children will have particular problems They should provide for simple recreation
There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake
To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy Records such as diaries can be kept
The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio A record should be kept of the information and instructions including the time and date of broadcast
Family rationing probably will be necessary
Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement However as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum
The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied Food medical supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it
After the family has settled in the shelter the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge
Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning
Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet A 10-gallon garbage can with a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter
Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully
A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning Even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature Warm clothing and bedding of course are essential
Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided A flame would use up air
Some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need
4 If an attack finds you without a prepared shelter Few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about
A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house
A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground
If there is time after the warning the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material
5 Shelter in apartment buildings Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings In general such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space
The central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling
The Federal Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide and for how many people
The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management

A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont's share of the General Motors market Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating divisions The Fisher Body division long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock followed an independent course for many years but by 1947 and 1948 resistance had collapsed and its purchases from Du Pont compared favorably with purchases by other General Motors divisions Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years but it is likely that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont's capacity
The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit 353 U. S. at 605
This Court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors 353 U. S. at 606 However it determined that neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone including Du Pont's competitors outweighed the Government's claim for relief This claim as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it 126 F.Supp.235 alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act The latter provisions proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize such trade However this Court put to one side without consideration the Government's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations It rested its decision solely on 7 which reads in pertinent part
No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce
This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial lessening of competition
The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion
Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial lessening of competition have occurred or are intended 353 U. S. at 589
Thus a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's decision Indeed as already noted the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies This however did not bar finding that Du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General Motors that these products constituted a line of commerce within the meaning of the Clayton Act that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns
The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute We repeat that the test of a violation of 7 is whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition 353 U. S. at 607
On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this
The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute The District Courts in the framing of equitable decrees are clothed with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case International Salt Co. v. United States 332 U. S. 392 400-401 353 U. S. at 607-608
This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court
2
This Court's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 1957 The first pretrial conference held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings took place on September 25 1957 At the outset the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court Du Pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont General Motors relationship The Government deeming these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include divestiture of Du Pont's shares of General Motors Counsel for the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days
Counsel for Du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date No previous antitrust case he said had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out
The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 1957 The plan called for divestiture by Du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders as a dividend over a period of ten years Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty & Investment Company major stockholders in Du Pont and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee again over a ten-year period of Du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to them as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright If in the trustee's judgment reasonable market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten-year period In addition the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be vested in Du Pont's stockholders other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware Du Pont Christiana and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors Du Pont Christiana and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors and vice versa and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies
On motion of the Amici Curiae the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government's plan On May 9 1958 the Commissioner announced his rulings The annual dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits The measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont's tax basis for them which is approximately $2.09 per share The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate
Du Pont's counterproposal was filed on May 14 1958 Under its plan Du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares Christiana and Delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders Du Pont would be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors and no director officer or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders
On June 6 1958 General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal It argued inter alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this Court
The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in August of 1958 These plans like Du Pont's contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont Christiana and Delaware except that officers and directors of the three companies their spouses and other people living in their households as well as other specified persons were to be totally disenfranchised Both plans also prohibited common directors officers or employees between Du Pont Christiana and Delaware on the one hand and General Motors on the other

It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the oneness of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States 362 U.S. 525 where the Court held that under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage The Court's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine enthrones an unreality into a rule of law I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed But in any event I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress not to this Court I dissent Petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector was convicted of violating 12a of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment because 1 at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board and 2 at the trial he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim Held On the record in this case the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with petitioner was not denied due process and his conviction is sustained Pp. 60-66 A Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board Pp. 62-63 B Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's recommendation to the appeal board Pp. 63-64 C Petitioner was not entitled either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation since he was furnished a resume of it did not challenge its accuracy and showed no particular need for the original report Pp. 64-66
Haydn C. Covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner
Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin Assistant Attorney General Wilkey Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop
Mr. Justice Clark delivered the opinion of the Court
This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act 62 Stat. 604,622 50 U.S.C. App. Aj 462 A Petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector contends that he was denied due process both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board and further that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim all in violation of the Fifth Amendment The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment The Court of Appeals affirmed 269 F. 2d 613 We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act 361 U. S. 899 We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States 348 U.S. 407 1955 and United States v. Nugent 346 U.S. 1 1953 and therefore affirm the judgment
Petitioner registered with Local Board No. 9 Boulder Colorado on March 17 1952 His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching On November 13 1952 he was classified in Class 1-a On November 22 1952 he wrote the Board protesting this classification He again stated that he was a regular minister that he was devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in any form Thereafter he was classified 1-o On April 1 1953 after some six months of full-time pioneering petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so notify his local board In a periodic review the local board on July 30 1953 reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home Upon administrative approval of the reclassification he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 1956 but failed to do so He was not prosecuted however and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of Sicurella v. United States 348 U.S. 385 1955 He was again reclassified 1-a by the local board There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing at which petitioner appeared In his report to the Attorney General the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service On March 21 1957 however the Department recommended approval of the 1-a classification Its ground for this recommendation was that while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 1956 as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and on the contrary had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions It reported that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities His claim was therefore so highly exaggerated the Department concluded that it cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation In his answer thereto he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 and asserted that his only claim to pioneering was in 1952 The appeal board however unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation Upon return of the file to the local board petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so
Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer This he failed to do asserting that he did not know it to be in his file Apparently he never took the trouble to find out Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial This he did We found in Gonzales v. United States supra that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant We said there that it was necessary that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the Department's recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification 348 U.S. at 412 We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it As was said in Gonzales it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered final in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact Estep v. United States 327 U.S. 114 348 U. S. at 412-413
But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult At his trial petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces the longhand notes of the Department's hearing officer Evensen as well as his report thereon Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose
Section 6(j) of the Act as we have held does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a registrant's file Gonzales v. United States supra But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant While the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the registrant's file this requirement was eliminated in 1952 Moreover the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental is directed to the Attorney General and of course is not the recommendation of the Department It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice of which the Attorney General receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board
It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed
It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial In addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes While there are now allegations of the withholding of favorable evidence developed at the hearing and a denial of a full and fair hearing no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process Moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts In the light of these circumstances as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report and notes
Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial He did receive a resume of it the same that was furnished the appeal board and he made no claim of its inaccuracy Even now no such claim is asserted He bases his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent supra There we held that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitles conscientious objectors to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection 346 U.S. at 5-6 Even if we were not bound by Nugent petitioner here would not be entitled to the report The recommendation of the Department as well as the decision of the appeal board was based entirely on the local board file not on an FBI report

Foreign policy in its total context With this enlarged role in mind I should like to make a few suggestions What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context We regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad That means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable and active this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences between this and other departments Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy
I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action Every policy officer help but be a planning officer Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present The movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control
There will of course be times for delay and inaction What I am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties
I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas an affliction of all bureaucracies We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function regardless of rank
Further I would hope that we could pay attention to little things While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort To cite only a few examples The wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them
If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country He is expected to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action
The problems of a policy officer It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces This means practically everybody in this room Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine
The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli an idea in his own head the suggestions of a colleague a question from the Secretary or the President a proposal by another department a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news item read at the breakfast table a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference a speech by a Senator or Congressman an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad et cetera ad infinitum The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility
His first thought is about the question itself Is there a question here for American foreign policy and if so what is it For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer
Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the question tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed into one which can be answered
Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions He knows that he must give the expert his place but he knows that he must also keep him in it
He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy well-established precedents the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties basic statutes and well-understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department
He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted He must think about which of these principles must take precedence He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it be handled without relation to the whole when the whole is too large to grasp
He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted What is the probable attitude of other governments including those less directly involved How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted
If action is indicated what kind of action is relevant to the problem The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money be required Should the action be unilateral or multilateral Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body For if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem
Respect for the opinions of mankind What type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it He is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind And given probable public attitudes about which reasonably good estimates can be made what action is called for to insure necessary support
May I add a caution on this particular point We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action In the first place our business is foreign policy and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem Mr. Truman emphasized this point by saying You fellows in the Department of State know much about domestic politics
This is an important consideration If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership We test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action I doubt for example that 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals
The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors political military economic financial legal legislative procedural administrative to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which be under control
And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels

While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project
There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment
Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services
Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living They should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts Some special health requirements might have to be met For example it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers Perhaps existing Public Health Service State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized
For readjustment to the U.S. volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served
7 In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established
The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people Support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines The Peace Corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development
For this the Peace Corps should be administered by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation
Pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State When the aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional unit Meanwhile the Peace Corps could be physically located in ICA's facilities and depend on the State Department and ICA for administrative support and when needed program assistance
In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations
8 How and when should the Peace Corps be launched
The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates special funds for it or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action with sufficient funds and made available from existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer
The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses
If launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall Within a year or two several thousand might be in service It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated
9 What would the first projects be
In the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects The need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest
There would however be a variety of other skills medical agricultural engineering which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects
The first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America Africa and Asia
10 How will the Peace Corps be received abroad
Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends
It is important however that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community In presenting it to other governments and to the United Nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands In any case our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician helpers in development projects of the U.N. and other international agencies
The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach The Peace Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower If presented in this spirit the response and the results will be immeasurably better
11 How will it be financed
The already appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's pilot programs of the Peace Corps If it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security Act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign to the world Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year
Specifically Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large For this must be the project of the whole American people An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding
Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel
The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies universities international organizations and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored
12 Is it worth the cost and the risks
No matter how well conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures These could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad
But as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the Peace Corps is very great It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world
With thousands of young Americans going to work in developing areas millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before
With colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program and with students looking toward Peace Corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness The letters home the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world And this is meeting the world's need too since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world
The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to America's world policy one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting As you said in your State of the Union message The problems are towering and unprecedented and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well
To the Congress of the United States I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower
I have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis
The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization In addition by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall This temporary Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security Act and will be located in the Department of State Its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program
Throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires Our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty
One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations
The vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge
To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations
This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them

Wildlife habitat resources In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing Hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment
The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are 1
Revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources 2
Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs including A big-game gamebird and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands B fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments and C participation in planning inspection and control phases of all habitat improvement land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States other Federal agencies and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values 3
Improve food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas 4
Develop wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres 5
Improve 7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing banks planting streamside cover and constructing channel improvements
Protection The total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized They kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage values and disrupt uses
The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet If it were not for the effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952 About 45 percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease 20 percent to insects 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animals and various other causes
These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows and upon the other renewable forest resources
The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations In addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease Protection from insects and disease In the 10-year period it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection The work will consist of 1
Intensification of present activities through A quicker more extensive and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks B more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage C quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic The initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated 2
Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed 3
Initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites 4
Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses Protection from fire It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads This will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation
Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for 1
Expansion modernization and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crews and equipment use This will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel 2
Adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely 3
Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks Protection from other damage Rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents such as porcupines and mice on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands These areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests Approximately 1.8 million acres of rangelands and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known
Roads and trails The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions This system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the Secretary of Commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the Secretary of Agriculture Both of these systems are essential for the production development and use of the National Forests
In the forest highway system there are now 24,400 miles of public roads These are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed It is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests
In the forest development road and trail system there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails These roads are largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests Construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads and 80,000 miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis
The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds
The presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as A the protection of forage timber and wildlife resources from fire insects and disease B the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas C the volume of timber that can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises D the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects and disease E the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals
The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible Furthermore roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve
The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services For the year 2000 this means servicing A the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year B recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors C a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet and D 60 million acres of rangelands
Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails About 26,500 miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000
Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows 1
Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails This constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities
Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices 2
Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period
Land adjustment land purchase land use Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular In some units National Forest ownership is well blocked together In many others the previous patenting of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership
Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership One consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land Some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands And some which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing nothing to the economy there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed Lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern States
The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands

Strategy and tactics of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care mindful that the one type of warfare be safely neglected in favor of the other Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war
Forces and military personnel strength
This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and women in the active forces The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000 men a Navy of 817 active ships and 619,000 men a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 men and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men
If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers Under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare
Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity
I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 respectively to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives
Military personnel costs
About 30% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel These expenditures are estimated to be $12.1 billion an increase of $187 million over 1960 reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay and social security tax increases effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 Retired pay costs are increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961
Traditionally rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 1958 I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates
Operation and maintenance
Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $10.3 billion in 1961 which is $184 million more than in 1960 The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment
A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential Also the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year
Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up 11% in two years and of each steaming hour up 15% In total these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces
In the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 1951 65 Stat. 365 This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives As I have stated previously the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles Accordingly if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise
Basic long-line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army Air Force and Federal Aviation Agency The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met as they have in other States through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska and its early enactment is desirable
Procurement research and construction
Approximately 45% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement research development and construction programs In 1961 these expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion compared to $19.3 billion in 1960 The decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960
New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement excluding amounts for related research and construction totals $4,753 million which is $1,390 million below that enacted for 1960 On the other hand the new authority of $3,825 million proposed for missile procurement excluding research and construction in 1961 is $581 million higher than for 1960 These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead
The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items As I have repeatedly stated this provision is much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the Buy American Act I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider
The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under development
Furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events Thus in the last few years a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated For example the importance of the Regulus 2 a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines
Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid-1960's The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles Considering the high cost of the F-108 system over $4 billion for the force that had been planned and the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to stop further work on the project Meanwhile other air defense forces are being made effective as described later in this message
The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and deployed but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile
The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft particularly our heavy bombers Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program As a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed
These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it
Strategic forces
The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers carrier-based aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles The second capability is represented by our deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement
The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 a long-range supersonic bomber This aircraft which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier The first Atlas ICBM's are now operational the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year and the first Titan ICBM's next year The Minuteman solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963 By 1965 several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established
Thus the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful However I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system
I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 the B-52H with the new turbofan engine and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers one B-52 can do the work of several B-47's which it will replace Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile
In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas Titan and Polaris missiles also will be procured

Purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities including the classes types and/or varieties of food grain the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale and other relevant matters 3
The United States recognizes the desire of India to accumulate as quickly as possible a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal markets for this commodity in India Under this Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960 At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 disposal India's production consumption and stocks of food grains other imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United States India's storage capacity and other related factors any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year 4
The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30 1961 shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 of the Act at that time The United States Government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time after June 30 1961 that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency
Article 2 uses of rupees 1
The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement will be used by the Government of the United States of America in such manner and order of priority as the Government of the United States of America shall determine for the following purposes in the amounts shown A For United States expenditures under subsections A B D E F H through R of Section 104 of the Act or under any of such subsections the rupee equivalent of $200 million B For grant to the Government of India under subsection E of Section 104 of the Act the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may from time to time be mutually agreed C For loan to the Government of India under subsection G of Section 104 of the Act the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may be mutually agreed The terms and conditions of the loan and other provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two Governments

Article 3 deposit of rupees The deposit of rupees to the account of the Government of the United States of America in payment for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed by the Government of the United States of America except excess costs resulting from the requirement that United States flag vessels be used shall be made at the rate of exchange for United States dollars generally applicable to import transactions excluding imports granted a preferential rate in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement by United States banks or by the Government of the United States of America as provided in the purchase authorizations
Article 4 general undertakings 1
The Government of India agrees that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes except where such resale transshipment or use is specifically approved by the Government of the United States of America of the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and to assure that the purchase of such commodities does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities for export from India 2
The two Governments agree that they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases of surplus agricultural commodities pursuant to the Agreement will not displace usual marketings of the United States of America in these commodities or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries 3
In carrying out this Agreement the two Governments will seek to assure to the extent practicable conditions of commerce permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural commodities 4
The Government of India agrees to furnish upon request of the United States of America information on the progress of the program particularly with respect to the arrival and condition of commodities and the provisions for the maintenance of usual marketings and information relating to exports of the same or like commodities

This broad delegation leaves within our discretion subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided 3
The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast AM band from 540 kc. to 1600 kc. Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other The extent of such interference which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations depends on many factors among the principal ones being the distance between the stations their respective radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others With the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances Rather such assignments are made as they must be on the basis of certain overall rules and standards representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem taking into account for each situation some of the variables e.g. power and station separations and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable By this standard it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B's signal at that point 4
The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere All AM stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals at all hours but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general negligible But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility of one station's rendering service via skywave at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band with many more stations operating during the day than at night 5
It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous process but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise During the period of about 4 hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail during the same period around sunrise skywave transmission is declining until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance However in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose Accordingly the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations Class 2 stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset for daytime class 2 stations or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 station where located west of the class 2 station for limited-time class 2 stations
The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 stations operating on regional channels which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other With respect to nighttime assignments the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves figs. 1 and 2 of sec. 3.190 of the rules giving average skywave values These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data It was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength For this reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated secondary in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave primary service and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded 50 percent of the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference
Allocation policies 6
As mentioned the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations The rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation Our objectives as we have stated many times are 1 To provide some service to all listeners 2 To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible 3 To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others Accordingly the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations Some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 A or Class 1 B clear-channel stations designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service both groundwave and at night skywave over large areas and at great distances being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective In dealing with these frequencies the objective listed first above provision of service to all listeners was predominant the other objectives were subordinated to it The class 1 stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0.1-mv./m. groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference With respect to skywave service rendered at night class 1 A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 A operation and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received class 1 B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference Since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference only class 1 stations are capable of rendering skywave service But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it 7
With respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local and assigned for use by class 3 and class 4 stations respectively stations operating generally with lower power In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible 8
As mentioned the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference During nighttime hours because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it Therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of these channels no station other than the dominant class 1 A station is permitted to operate at night so that the 1 A station can render service interference free wherever it can be received On the remainder of the clear channels the dominant class 1 B stations are protected as described above and the relatively small number of secondary class 2 stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 stations In the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels Additional class 2 assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 stations or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities Such additional daytime class 2 assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them Similarly on the regional channels many class 3 stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power 9
Essentially the question presented for decision in the present Daytime Skywave proceeding is whether our decision in 1938-1939 to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset is sound as a basis for AM allocations or whether in the light of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours
The history of the proceeding 10
The decision reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof Since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena In 1947 affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours from class 2 stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference

If you were required to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961 it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 1962 if you file your income tax return Form 1040 and pay your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31 1962 The filing of an original or amended declaration otherwise due on January 15 1962 is also waived if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and pay the full tax by January 31 1962 Farmers for these purposes have until February 15 1962 to file Form 1040 and pay the tax in full for the calendar year 1961 Fiscal year taxpayers have until the last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal year farmers until the 15th day of the 2d month See Chapter 38
Nonresident aliens living in Canada or Mexico who earn wages in the United States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages the same as if they were citizens of the United States Their United States tax returns are due April 16 1962 However if their United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages their returns are due June 15 1962 if they use a calendar year or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of their fiscal year Nonresident aliens in Puerto Rico
If you are a nonresident alien and a resident of Puerto Rico your return is also due June 15 1962 or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of your fiscal year
If A taxpayer dies the executor administrator or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the deceased taxpayer's normal tax year Suppose John Jones who for 1960 filed on the basis of a calendar year died June 20 1961 His return for the period January 1 to June 20 1961 is due April 16 1962
The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax In such a case Form 1310 should be completed and attached to the return This form may be obtained from the local office of your district director
Returns of estates or trusts are due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the tax year Extensions of time for filing
Under unusual circumstances a resident individual may be granted an extension of time to file a return You may apply for such an extension by filing Form 2688 Application For Extension Of Time To File with the District Director of Internal Revenue for your district or you may make your application in a letter Your application must include the following information 1 your reasons for requesting an extension 2 whether you filed timely income tax returns for the 3 preceding years and 3 whether you were required to file an estimated return for the year and if so whether you did file and have paid the estimated tax payments on or before the due dates Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments when due must be fully explained Extensions are not granted as a matter of course and the reasons for your request must be substantial If you are unable to sign the request because of illness or other good cause another person who stands in close personal or business relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf stating the reason why you are unable to sign You should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refused your return may still be on time See also Interest On Unpaid Taxes below Extensions while abroad
Citizens of the United States who on April 15 are not in the United States or Puerto Rico are allowed an extension of time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar year An extension of 2 months beyond the regular due date for filing is also available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal year Alaska and Hawaii
Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also allowed this extension of time for filing but those residing or traveling in Hawaii are not allowed this automatic extension
Military or Naval Personnel on duty in Alaska or outside the United States and Puerto Rico are also allowed this automatic extension of time for filing their returns
You must attach a statement to your return if you take advantage of this automatic extension showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date Interest on unpaid taxes
Interest at the rate of 6% a year must be paid on taxes that are not paid on or before their due date Such interest must be paid even though an extension of time for filing is granted When payment is due
If your computation on Form 1040 or Form 1040A shows you owe additional tax it should be remitted with your return unless you owe less than $1 in which case it is forgiven If payment is by cash you should ask for a receipt If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax you will be sent a bill if additional tax is due This bill should be paid within 30 days Payment by check or money order
Whether the check is certified or uncertified the tax is not paid until the check is paid If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date deadline elapses additions to the tax may be incurred Furthermore a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties All checks and money orders should be made payable to Internal Revenue Service Refunds
An overpayment of income and social security taxes entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the overpayment should be applied to your succeeding year's estimated tax
If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax any refund to which you are entitled will be mailed to you
If you file a Form 1040 you should indicate in the place provided that there is an overpayment of tax and the amount you want refunded and the amount you want credited against your estimated tax
Refunds of less than $1 will not be made unless you attach a separate application to your return requesting such a refund Where to file
Send your return to the Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence or principal place of business If you have neither a legal residence nor a principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district your return should be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue Baltimore 2 Md. If your principal place of abode for the tax year is outside the United States including Alaska and Hawaii Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal residence or principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district in the United States you should file your return with the Office of International Operations Internal Revenue Service Washington 25 D.C. Adjusted gross income The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis It is the amount you enter on line 9 page 1 of Form 1040 Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine Adjusted Gross Income Other deductions are subtracted only from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income
To compute your adjusted gross income you total all items of income See Chapter 6 From this amount deduct the items indicated below
Businessmen deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses attributable to a trade or business Rents or royalties
If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you subtract in computing Adjusted Gross Income ordinary and necessary expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property See Chapter 15
Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable to earning a salary commission or other compensation See Chapter 10
Employees deduct expenses of travel meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance of their services as employees They also deduct transportation expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees even though they are not away from home See Chapter 12 If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred you deduct such expenses if they otherwise qualify See Chapter 10
Sick pay if included in your Gross Income is deducted in arriving at Adjusted Gross Income If your sick pay is not included in your Gross Income you may not deduct it See Chapter 9 income from estates and trusts
If you are a life tenant you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion If you are an income beneficiary of property held in trust or an heir legatee or devisee you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion if not deductible by the estate or trust
Deductible losses on sales or exchanges of property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income See Chapter 20 50% of capital gains
You also deduct 50% of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income See Chapter 24 other deductions
Certain other deductions are not allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income They may be claimed only by itemizing them on page 2 of Form 1040 These deductions may not be claimed if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or Tax Table See Chapters 30 through 37
2 Minors minors must also file returns if they earn $600 or more during the year
A minor is subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may under local law have the right to them and might actually have received the money His income is not required to be included in the return of his parent
A minor child is allowed A personal exemption of $600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn Exemption also allowed parent
If your child is under 19 or is a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as your dependent even though he earns $600 or more See Chapter 5 Example
Your 16 year old son earned $720 in 1961 You spent $800 for his support Since he had gross income of $600 or more he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $600 Since you contributed more than half of his support you may also claim an exemption for him on your return He may get a tax refund
A minor who has gross income of less than $600 is entitled to a refund if income tax was withheld from his wages Generally the refund may be obtained by filing Form 1040A accompanied by the withholding statement Form W-2 If he had income other than wages subject to withholding he may be required to file Form 1040 See Chapter 1
If your child works for you you may deduct reasonable wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your business You may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally obligated to furnish him and even though you may be entitled to his services

The one- or two-season hunt of which there have been too many recently may do more harm than good for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued and they are dashed no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit
For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time
The central group of the Foundation's advisors are at any one period of time the members of our Advisory Board consisting now of thirty-six men and women They are chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts Their locations in all parts of the United States and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees' minds For this concept of an Advisory Board ancillary to the Board of Trustees we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University A. Lawrence Lowell a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly pretty uniformly good
For in accordance with Mr. Lowell's concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices And lest we should become too consistent in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains a trickle not a flow of new members through the Advisory Board
Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection one for the selection of Fellows from Canada the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics and the Republic of the Philippines
To the members of our Advisory Board and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of Fellows We are as we know utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get and quality of advice added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and ideals we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day
But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members' duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative on which to base our selections of Fellows For example the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were formally members of that Board And besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants of government and men of affairs hundreds indeed who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience
To all the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are
It is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management The same is true of every foundation During the biennium reviewed in this Report our Board of Trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation's affairs
Dr. James Brown Fisk physicist President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories was elected to the Board of Trustees He is a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions
Dr. Gordon N. Ray Provost Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois was appointed Associate Secretary General The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter's eventual retirement Dr. Ray is a Fellow of the Foundation appointed thrice to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H. G. Wells and before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff had been given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the Advisory Board
Referring further to the Foundation's officers Dr. James F. Mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as Associate Secretary was promoted to be Secretary He is a historian with the great merit of a historian's long view
Also appointed to the Foundation's staff as Assistant Secretary is Mr. J. Kellum Smith Jr. Mr. Smith like the present Secretary General is a lawyer and lawyers with the great virtues that they are trained to read the fine print carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields are indispensable even in a foundation office
The present Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago But even he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are quite simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation's policies and practices The effective recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day nor even in a year
We are not given to lamentations neither personally nor in these Reports On the contrary if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity For granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved these problems make great demands and by their demanding tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth Of this examples are legion Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount close to his ultimate sacrifice Shakespeare speaking with the indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice Keats's words in the days of the Spanish Armada's threats Isaac Newton at the age of twenty-three industriously calculating logarithms to two and fifty places during the great plague year in England 1665 Winston Churchill's Olympian optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago the present-day explorations of outer space answering age-old questions of science and philosophy in the face of possible wars of extinction
Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the Roman poet Virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today It gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind
For example out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men until today in the industrialized West these social evils substantially do not exist The solutions were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government lawyers most of them and men of business These were educated men who as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility That is to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit or they had to get the votes to get elected Nevertheless they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the workers to use Marx's word more than a subsistence wage with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase
But as all understand who have eyes to see nothing of the kind has happened indeed the contrary has happened The gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed in the industrialized Western world to the point that the word poor is hardly applicable And the reason this could happen is clear men of government business men lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong
Sir Henry Sumner Maine a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with wrote his brilliant legal generalization that the progress of society is from status to contract The essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do Hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice The greater the range of freedom for individual men the greater the range of choice the greater the range of choice the greater the rate of change For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose men individual men must remain in status and society does not progress
The eternal truth is that progress due as it always is to individual creative genius is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart
And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten them with the truths that under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative efforts for the good of mankind
During the year 1959 we granted 354 Fellowships in 1960 we granted 334 As heretofore our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts We do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic creation is good provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does Indeed if pressed we would say what the late Robert Henri American painter said to a pupil Anything will do for a subject what you do with it that counts
Thus we have no part and want none in current discussions of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities the creative arts We want no part in such discussions because we think them largely futile and we think them largely futile because for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view

When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world
With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder Joseph R. Brown and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology
Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 He was early exposed to the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father David Brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls Rhode Island and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business for himself in 1831 making lathes and small tools This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 under the name D. Brown & Son a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe
The years of Joseph's partnership with his father were numbered In 1838 a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years
Joseph Brown continued in business by himself quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world
Much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with clock movements During these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man's occupation He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period But his business also grew and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 1848 Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically cryptic style Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice
The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm the company became J. R. Brown & Sharpe and entered into a new and important period of its development Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted time for tinkering and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time
By 1853 the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine That development in turn formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years in gear cutting in circular graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement
Throughout their careers both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades Several efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive to this day the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today
As one development followed another the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture In 1858 the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine
As the story goes Mr. Gibbs who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine Curious as to what made it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling the crude machine to take stitches When he showed this model as his solution as to how the Howe sewing machine operated he was told he was wrong and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture
The new work was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment
The turret screw machine now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible tap and die holders
In 1861 Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem the manufacture of twist drills At that time during the Civil War Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation The child of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous Serial No. 1 Universal Milling Machine the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world The original machine bearing its famous serial number is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence
During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth but they were good for only one sharpening As soon as the time came for re-sharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form Mr. Brown's invention achieved this and as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of Brown & Sharpe's position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920's when superceded by other methods
The micrometer caliper as a common workshop tool also owes much to J. R. Brown Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor it was a French idea it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day
The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition This machine like its milling counterpart was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world Along with J. R. Brown's other major developments the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come
Following Mr. Brown's death there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company One such man was Samuel Darling
As head of the firm Darling & Swartz Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850's and early 60's In 1868 however a truce was called between the companies and the partnership of Darling Brown & Sharpe was formed Between that year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892 a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling Brown & Sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark
Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world
Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene at the turn of the century was Mr. Richmond Viall Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 Mr. Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad
Commencing with the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899 the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company During his presidency the company's physical plant was enormously expanded and the length and breadth of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world During the early part of this century the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world
During these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines In the grinding machine field expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface grinders and a wide variety of special and semi-special models
In 1951 Henry D. Sharpe Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts
The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines grinding machines of many types and knee and bed-type milling machines Recently added is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development
In the Industrial Products Division the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment machinists' tools including micrometers Vernier calipers and accessories
In the Cutting Tool Division the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters end mills and saws

Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 Net income was $2,557,111 or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959 adjusted to the same number of shares
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960 This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development
In spite of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959
Outlook for current year Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960
However the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961
Need for sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis could if adopted have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years
Such a depreciation policy would also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange
Research and development Our research and development program serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona
This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money
Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility But more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine
Budget increased On this basis our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings
Much of this necessary increase in research and development though properly chargeable to current expenses is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity usually over a period of several years
Stretch yarn machines In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics During the past year great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics
This machine operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today It transfers yarn directly from the producers' largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics
Large-package twister Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills Later in the year additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment
Uniconer Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder
The Uniconer has several outstanding features it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production at the same time upgrading quality Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine
New Unifil application A new application for the Unifil loom winder running single filling for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment
Take-up machines A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed
This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time
Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns in several fiber producing plants We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field
Diversification plans We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction
Patterson Moos research Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation has been important in this work In addition to its major effort on fuel cells Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields both under contract for the Defense Department other government agencies and for our own account PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs
We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil CSF of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country There is a rapidly growing demand for this material primarily from the military Further research we believe will develop important commercial applications
A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases
We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity
The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities
New plant facilities Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick Rhode Island which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations Construction is well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962
An architect's sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover The building will contain 430,000 square feet approximately the same as our present plant However its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs
A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site four miles from Cranston was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force
We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant
British subsidiary During the year our British subsidiary Leesona-Holt Limited expanded its plant in Darwen England and added machine tool capacity The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations In addition land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future
Financial developments The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island a non-profit organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction We will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase These arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to Leesona Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank
In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt Limited We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment
Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000 Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position
Employee contracts In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May 1959 with the International Association of Machinists AFL-CIO wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May 1960 and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately In addition Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations
Personnel benefits In addition to direct salaries and wages the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees
During the pension year ended December 31 1960 23 employees retired making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan At December 13 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan totaled $2,412,616
The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living
As in many other industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years
Increased efficiency In textiles as elsewhere a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity
As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility
Problems of shifting styles The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration Production must be adjusted accordingly at minimum cost and quickly
In addition production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends

Following the term of service in Japan each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program
Musical activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining under skilled direction the Choir the Orchestra the Band the Glee Club and smaller ensembles of wind and string players
All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify Orchestra Band and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership
In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year there are concerts by students of the music department by members of the music faculty and by visiting artists
Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones men's vocal groups and the Keynotes a women's singing group These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each they perform at many campus social events
Religious activities from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion Courses are offered in ethics the philosophy and history of religion Christian thought and history and the Bible Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students
A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel The sermons are given by the College Chaplain by members of the faculty or by guest preachers Music is furnished by the Carleton College Choir
Chapel services are held weekly These services at which attendance is voluntary are led by the Chaplain by the President of the College by selected faculty members students and visitors The service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced
A Sunday evening program provides theological lectures music drama and films related to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition
Attendance is required at the College Service of Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship Each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary
Religious organizations include the groups described below The Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes Occasional meetings are held for the whole membership usually with a guest speaker while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships to broaden their interests and to engage in worthwhile service projects
There are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups Included are the following Baptist Student Movement Canterbury Club Episcopal Christian Science Organization Friends' Meeting for Worship Hillel Jewish Liberal Religious Fellowship Lutheran Student Association Newman Club Roman Catholic Presbyterian Student Fellowship United Student Fellowship Congregational-Baptist and Wesley Fellowship Methodist
Student religious organizations are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association
The Northfield churches include the following Alliance Congregational-Baptist Episcopal Lutheran Norwegian Danish Missouri Synod and Bethel Methodist Moravian Pentecostal and Roman Catholic
Theater the purpose of producing plays at the College is three-fold to provide the Carleton students with the best possible opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available to encourage the practice of attending the theater and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance
Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried on by The Carleton Players which is to say by all students who are so inclined to advance these aims
For the 1960-1961 season The Carleton Players have announced Blood Wedding by Federico Garcia Lorca The Knight Of The Burning Pestle by Beaumont and Fletcher and A Moon For The Misbegotten by Eugene O'Neill with a pre-season production of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams

A student organization Bottega is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical technical and productive contexts The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop They are assisted and advised by members of the Art Department
Athletics the Athletic program at Carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the College and operates under the same budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work
The physical education program for men recognizes the value of participation in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic competition either intercollegiate or intramural
The same standards for admission for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students
A faculty committee on athletics responsible to the faculty as a whole exercises control over the athletic program of the College It concerns itself with 1
The policies which govern the program 2
The preservation of desirable balance between the athletic and academic programs of the College 3
The approval of athletic schedules 4
The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility standards
Carleton is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules In addition to these rules Carleton has added the following 1
A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates in an athletic contest during the school year other than that sponsored by the College shall be permanently ineligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also face permanent suspension from the institution The school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester 2
A student to be eligible for the captaincy of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1.00
The C club is composed of the men of the College who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body This is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton cheerleaders Soccer Club
The Soccer Club was organized by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players Practices are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by the student coach and the officers of the club Women's Recreation Association
This Association organized in 1920 is affiliated with the Athletic Federation of College Women The purpose of the organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency sportsmanship and play for play's sake The Association is governed by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes Membership is open to any woman student in the College Active groups sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club Orchesis Golf Club Tennis Club and Dolphins The Saddle Club open to students proficient in horsemanship presents the Annual Spring Riding Exhibition and during the year it offers speakers movies breakfast rides and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport Orchesis for students interested in the modern dance contributes to the May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University of Minnesota each fall and also sponsors a two-day state invitational tennis meet at Carleton in May The Dolphins present a three-night water show the week of the May Fete Under the auspices of the Women's Recreation Association interclass competition is organized in badminton basketball field hockey golf tennis and swimming The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and sponsors several Play Days with St. Olaf and other nearby colleges With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education for Men the Women's Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments in tennis and golf in the fall and spring Throughout the year there are social events such as picnics breakfast hikes canoe trips banquets and indoor parties

In recent months much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future And yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade 1960 has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level
In the electronics industry this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below 1959 The total value of our industry's shipments at factory prices increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business home entertainment military industrial and replacement I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961
Home entertainment sales up Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 1959 Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July set production excluding those destined for the export market also ran ahead in the early months but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic For the year as a whole retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 however production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million
In contrast to the lower turnout of TV total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million excluding export Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959 Separate phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market
The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 15.5 million sets I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 million slightly below 1960 but above 1959
Military electronics to grow 1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959 It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability While this may well be true in general I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions
Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command and improved battlefield surveillance systems Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially Research development test and evaluation funds devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 Still later the realm of space technology will show substantial gains it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20%
The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $6 billion
Industrial electronic equipment Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959 The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually reaching some $450 million in 1960 Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information storage and retrieval In the industrial field prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright For the near term however it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years sales should slightly exceed 1960 however and reach $1.9 billion
Replacement parts In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year This is now a $1.0 billion business up from $0.9 billion in 1959 and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961
The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates In the military field incoming orders turned down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components
Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 Sales of passive components such as capacitors and resistors although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year and should increase again in 1961
In sum I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally As I have indicated above I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 on prospects for continued increases in defense spending and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's
The appointment of Gilbert B. Devey as General Manager of VecTrol Engineering Inc. of Stamford Connecticut a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls has been announced by David B. Peck Vice President Special Products
Mr. Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers working closely with Walter J. Brown President and Director of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary Mr. Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff
Mr. Devey's new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of Sprague's Special Products Group which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components packaged component assemblies and high temperature magnet wires
Mr. Devey first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington D. C. where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies During World War 2 he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy Mr. Devey is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and attended the United States Naval Academy Post-Graduate School specializing in electronic engineering He was named Product Manager of the Special Products Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958 and was later promoted to his present post Mr. Devey is a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers and is chairman of the Electronic Industries Association Committee on Printed and Modular Components
Mr. Brown well-known English-born inventor prior to founding VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. Ltd. chief engineer of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries Ltd. the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain Ltd. and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The Brush Development Co. Cleveland Ohio He has a Bachelor of Science from the University of Manchester England Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923 He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers He is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers London a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain
The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough Manager of Interference Control Field Service The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems

Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both jobs
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course
The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship The president expects faculty members to remember in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he has a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the administration
How well do faculty members govern themselves There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government They too need to learn to delegate Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention
Although faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government There are nevertheless several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege He can for example present significant university-wide issues to the senate He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration by minimizing the number of committees
Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack of communication persist The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose A busy president conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is The need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation
To increase faculty influence and decrease tension many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly
The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes but if he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take Success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and persistence
The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves
Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas but they also contribute to top-level decision making The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance
Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration The administration at the same time looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments One way that this can be done other than by hiring new high-priced professors is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance
The quality of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to
The academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty development An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job and bright prospects elsewhere
For the maintenance of a long-term program the departments and particularly their chairmen are strategic They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion To provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly
At some colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates Some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma They can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work At one university the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty
Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere The president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria To avoid passing over quiet unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments
There are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different In particular the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale On those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action
A true university like most successful marriages is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level which a university in contrast to a multiversity should stand for
Recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates Or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subjects In the first instance adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned In the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required
For the president a master plan looking ahead five years the maximum reach for sound forecasting offers several practical advantages Trustees faculty and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed Proposed new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts It inspires confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and to achieve them
Before deciding where it is going however a college or university must know where it is The first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination of the two It should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in stature and size
Implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically others may drag their feet Funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others A plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer
To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research Some offices have very broad responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a university's instructional program Their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations More often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data
The president's opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts
No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget to which his faith and credit are committed its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment He of course examine each proposal from scratch He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution
Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money an institution should choose its fields of prominence Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches
Supporting activities business management public relations fund-raising offer presidents one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role
In the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them Higher education compete with the salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income
Just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives so should non-academic officers They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals
A president is frequently besieged to serve in non-academic civic and governmental capacities to make speeches to lay groups and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus Since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance
By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution something more than the lengthened shadow of one man
