There were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating An interne a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us
I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago's grim dirty West Side It seemed incredible as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois going to a hospital for the mentally ill
I suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses
We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field & Co. She knew that I lived at a good address on the Gold Coast that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies She knew also that I was unmarried and without a single known relative She quite sure that I felt enough remorse about my drinking or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again This had worried her
I read those newspaper stories about you she had said You must have loved that girl very much but you have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her
Why do you say that I asked I was full of booze and well a drunk is apt to do anything he says do
Nonsense I grew up in an Irish neighborhood on Chicago's West Side tell me about drunks not the kind to go violent Were you in love with that girl
Would it make any difference to you if I were Mary Jane
She met my eyes suddenly angry I have gone into nursing if I care about people interested in every patient helped take care of When I think of people like you well I
You what Mary Jane
You are young intelligent have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but you mess it up with whiskey indifference self-destructive attitudes I blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you Was she pretty
Oh yes I said feeling annoyed she was very pretty You believe that going back to medical school and finish do you
Why should I worked this ward for three months now We keep getting the same ones back again and again They all mean well have great promises to make when they are about to go home but drinking is their sickness not seemed like them but maybe you are treated your stay here like a big joke not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover I wanted to go to college too
Why you I asked Chicago has some of the best
Her eyes flashed angrily what I mean about you Anderson she said You seem to know much about reality tell you why I go to college the oldest of six children My a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year There was no money for tuition for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted Nurses' training here cost anything They even pay me six dollars a month I think a good deal going to become a good nurse and got two baby brothers that are going to have college if I have to work at my profession until an old maid to give it to them
Do you have a boy friend I asked
none of your business she said then changed the subject What about your father and mother you think of them when in a place like this
My father and mother died when I was two years old I said My aunt raised me Aunt Mary died when I was doing my military service I have no one but myself to worry about
Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face
sorry she said I know what do without my family always been so close
Tell me more about them
Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother aunts and uncles cousins Listening I felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can When she had finished I said
Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman bet he be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date I mean after out of the hospital a month or so from now
My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years a pretty good judge of character Anderson I think mind too much if he were sure decided not to be a rumdum in the future
What about you How would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at Hanover
If I thought you were serious about going back to school that learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover well I might consider such an offer What about your that girl you were going to kill
It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me that I was not the confused sick irresponsible person she believed me to be
There are things about me that I tell you now Mary Jane I said but if go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover like to tell you the whole story I can say this dead serious about going back to school As for that other girl just say that I never want to see her again You will get to come home on long weekends from Hanover you
Yes get one overnight a month
go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner I said Do you like to dance They always have a good orchestra
I like to dance she said then turned and walked away
There been anything really personal in her interest in me I knew that It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there
Now riding this hospital bus feeling isolated and utterly alone I knew that she was genuine and unique quite unlike any girl I had known before It seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me
It was a fantastic story Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name or why It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane Brennan would believe it without proof But I had the proof all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so
As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in order I wondered suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me if I had not perhaps imagined it all Perhaps this was reality and Dale Nelson the actor was delusion a figment of Carl Anderson's imagination
Four I had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called Ask Tony It was a bad play real grade-A turkey which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal No one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway But because it was a suspense gangster story of the Capone era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago continue as a road company and eventually become a movie
Such optimism was completely unjustified The critics literally screamed their indignation Ask Tony was doomed from the moment Kupcinet leveled on it in his Sun-Times column We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday Out of the entire cast I alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer This let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company two members of which were native Chicagoans
We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York
I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel It seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another I had been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U. had wanted desperately to go to medical school but run out of money and energy at the same time Then later I had quit my safe secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play It seemed to me that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well I knew that soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life
I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water The telephone rang When I answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said Is this Mr. Dale Nelson the actor
All right I said Why you bastards lay off for a while
I beg your pardon sir
All right This is Dale Nelson the actor
Good calling you Mr. Nelson at the request of Mr. Phillip Wycoff Could you possibly have lunch with him today His car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve
I smiled send the Rolls-Royce of course
Yes of course Mr. Nelson
I started to say something else appropriate but the man had hung up
I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of Ask Tony They all bowed low as I approached them
All right you bastards I said the great actor is about to buy a drink
I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me I walked over to him
You Mr. Nelson He asked
right
Mr. Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance
I followed him out through the lobby to the street
An ancient Rolls-Royce as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb The elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car

I was giving the parked cars the once-over The Oldsmobile with the license number JYJ 114 was in stall number five
Okay I said to the attendant let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building
I walked with him back to the entrance He gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it
I was back in ten minutes Forgot to get something out of the car I told him showing him my ticket
He started to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said Oh yes the one I was talking to about a monthly rental
right I told him
He consulted the parking ticket then looked at a notation and said in the third row back toward the rear Can you find it all right
Sure I told him
I went back to the agency car and got out an electric bug one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing I always keep a set in the car
I put in new batteries so as to be certain have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully
I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer then slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114 attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out
The attendant waved me on
One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting
For the first fifteen or twenty minutes possible to be more or less interested in window displays then in people passing by After a while however a person's mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment You want to sit down Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary conscious of the fact that your feet hurt that the city pavements are hard
I waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building He came out alone
I far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car
The attendant recognized me once more and said What did you do about that office
I made up my mind yet I said a sublease I have a couple of them figuring on one here and one out quite a ways where usually curb parking
That curb parking is undependable and annoying particularly when it rains he said
I kept trying to get him to take my money Okay I told him in a rush right now I know where the car is Want me to drive it out
have one of the boys get it he said one of the rules on transients Regulars drive out their own cars
Make it as snappy as you can will you I asked
Oh all right he said going to be a regular get in the office building here You want to lease a place way out in the sticks You get business where the business is not where it
I grinned at him handed him a couple of dollars and said By the time you get the parking charge figured up there should be a cigar in it for you
I hurried over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left
I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn By the time made it he was gone Traffic was pretty heavy
I turned on the electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear
I made time and picked him up within ten blocks I stayed half a block behind him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady beep beep beep
After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left I see him but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead short half beeps when the car I was following was to the left and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to the right If it ever got behind me the beep turned to a buzz
I turned left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind me That meant parked someplace I made a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house
I found a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited
My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours Then he came out and started driving toward the beach
By this time it was dark I could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there traffic My lights would have been a giveaway if tried to shadow him in the conventional manner Moreover have lost him if it been for the electronic shadowing device His signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz I circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant
I sat where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry I sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee
My man came out an hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim and Tan Motel
It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place
I waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register
The card the man I was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter I noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of Oscar L. Palmer and wife giving a San Francisco address
He had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still good Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager check the license number on the plates against the license number the tenant writes out If he does still better than an even chance he notice the transposition of the numbers and if he should notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake
I used the alias of Robert C. Richards gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap but a couple of phony numbers in between
I could have written anything The manager of the motel was a woman who apparently care She was complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly checking license numbers or bothering the tenants
You mean all alone Mr. Richards
right
Your wife going to join you later
I think so
If you expect her to show up she said better put and wife on there a formality you know
Any difference in the rate I asked
Not to you she said smiling ten dollars either way There are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office There are three soft-drink vending machines and if you should be joined by anybody try to keep things quiet if you will We like to run a nice quiet place
Thank you I told her
I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car
The construction was reasonably solid not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment
I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case With the aid of that I could hear my man moving around heard him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound of water running
Whoever his companion was going to be she was going to join him later She knew where to come He have to telephone
I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed one thing to go without food when occupied with some work or when simply postponing a meal but when dependent on someone else and know that you eat until bedded down for the night hunger can be a gnawing torture
I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile The batteries on the bugging device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals The powerful microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry
I got in the car drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible
The place particularly busy at that time of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was and there was lots of it wanted to be sociable
You really in a hurry Handsome She asked
in a hurry Beautiful
early in the evening to be in a hurry lots of time left There may not be any women left I said
She gave a little pout and said I get off work until eleven o'clock when my evening commences
be here at ten-fifty-five I said
Oh you She announced what they all say that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car
I said Darn it the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on I turn it off I reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device
She went in to get the hamburgers and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling's car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the hamburgers Then I shut off the device again
She wanted to hang around while I was eating you think selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up
No I said a kindness to her You see on a diet eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and to have one with her so she feel out of place
Diets can be terrible the girl said How much overweight is she
Not a bit I said but keeping her figure in hand
She looked at me provocatively Good figures should be kept in hand she said and walked away with an exaggerated wiggle
I turned on the device again half fearful that I might find silence but the buzzes came in loud and clear
When I switched on the lights for her to come and get the check I had the exact change plus a dollar tip

The fat man said All we do is go around the corner
The gun moved The thin man said That-a-way
second building on the right
it says police right on the door
so even if we was as dumb as you take us for we could still find it
Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door The thin man waved the gun again He said Right around the corner
It says water works but there is a policeman on duty too
A night policeman just like in the States You know
Canada have much of this here juvenile delinquency problem but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists
At the door Dave paused to feel for the latch Roberta glanced up at her husband He was going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him She measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun measured the distance from the men to the back room She decided to risk it There was something phony about all this gun waving something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police
Dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open In a flash she was away to the back paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats She tore open the back door It was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top There was a small sideboard with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs
Slowly she turned to face the men again Rat-face at the counter was on his feet The distance between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles Keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter she began to feel her way to the door She sidled along the booths one step at a time The gun followed her
As she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren
The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind them watched them cross the sidewalk to their car It was getting light The fat man removed his apron put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket and zipped it over his paunch
The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number When he was answered he said Albert Vince sending you a couple of customers yeah just get them out of my hair and keep them out I give a damn what you tell them only believe a word they say out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them I care how and one more thing Cate's Cafe closed at eleven like always last night and Rose and Clarence Corsi left for Quebec yesterday some shrine or other I think it was called Saint Simon's yeah yesterday Got it
He turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant The white Buick moved away yet Good A line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side
He said Grosse You kidding me the kid know the name of this town
I kidding you Vince How could she She been walking in her sleep you seen her yourself in here
I know
Remember how she looked when Barney held the door for her Kinda like a zombie She was just waking up when we found her at the garage
Vince swore Stupid fools got enough brains between the two of you
Grosse muttered his head down one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents I let her go go His eyes were lowered so he have seen the narrow pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury but he was aware of it just the same He knew Vince Steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be
With a curse Vince seized the thing nearest a glass sugar container with a spouted metal top and threw it against the wall opposite The heavy glass break but the top flew off sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence
Not really startled but careful to appear so Grosse sucked noisily on his pipe Vince cursed steadily Why does everything have to happen to me
Grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar Vince watched him His mouth worked over the profanity the obscenities in his vocabulary Once he said hell you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off you and Barney ever use your brains
The fat man answer He got one of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter He returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser
He spoke soothingly She know nothing about them cars She thinks in a ordinary garage
How do you know stupid And put Cate's gun back
I know Grosse tucked the gun under the counter
one word of this gets to Guardino
telling Guardino
Vince swore again You get that kid over to Rose's house
The fat man winced He ran a finger down his cheek tracing the scratch there Why I leave her locked up in the tool crib
The thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock You and Barney get her over to Rose's before it gets too light After left dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home God help you if she knows where been
Grosse spread his hands What am I going to do with her all day In the tool crib she get away
What the hell do I care what you do with her all day Just get her where Guardino see her and start asking questions
Grosse swore now Dammit all Vince I no baby sitter
Vince shouted finally Get her over to Rose's and come by and see that she stays put
Grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen He spoke sullenly You get nasty I wish you luck when you try scaring that kid Suddenly he grinned His voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled I got one question
What is it Impatiently
Are you a poor dumb Canadian or a smart aleck from the States
Vince lifted his hand as if to strike but his thin lips spread in a smile Grosse ducked and sniggered you say you was born
In a Chicago slum just like you And I going back there on account of one lousy kid
Lauren Landis rubbed her face against the blanket She had cried a little because she was frightened She could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car she had figured that out but she understand their subsequent actions Was it because she had shown panic Who could blame her for that It was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you
She was glad the fat man had left Barney was not really frightening She jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a bottle of coke She smiled at him wetly Although she found she was thirsty she was about to refuse never never take candy from a strange man when she saw the bottle was unopened He placed a bottle opener on the counter So he understood her panic She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle It was icy cold and tasted delicious She felt a lift in spirit When she was finished she pushed it back The man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver's side of a car
She called softly Barney
He looked in her direction but he answer
She said Barney why is he keeping me here
Still no answer He seemed to be looking at a point above the little window
Lauren said Why I call my home Or borrow some money from someone and go home by bus I could send the money right back
Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe Now he looked at her He said I only work here
Lauren said Please But he was back at work on a car
She dropped her head on her arms on the counter How could he be kind one moment and cruel the next Did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her Her heart was thumping painfully the unknown was so much worse than what dangers lay ahead for her What awful thing had she to face in the next few hours Something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists Tears
With a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in she would think about something else Her mother and father for instance Where were they now In her mind she followed the white Buick along the road somewhere between here and the Niagara River Her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the Falls and took the River Road to LaSalle and finally turned in at their own driveway at 387 Heather Heights Then he would yawn and stretch and shout All out This is the end of the line
And what would her mother be doing right now Her mother would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful big safe solid shoulder next to her on the front seat
Lauren Landis was in trouble and she was alone
Roberta Landis put her hand on her husband's arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her Somewhere birds were sweetly calling were answered Her teeth chattered so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible
Dave I saw that woman's apron behind the door There was a wet spot she have been gone long
Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement He inserted the car key in the lock Roberta was violently trembling
She stammered You heard what he said about police Why we drive around the corner
The car door crashed shut The engine throbbed into life Dave said I got the message going
Roberta said no You go Walk Suppose Lauren comes looking for us I can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner
The big car sprang away from the curb like something alive He said not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those
Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling

His jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard His small mean eyes regarded Marty steadily unblinkingly His eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them As he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath Marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey
Marty recognized the man He had driven the car that passed them on the road outside Admassy's place This was Acey Squire proprietor of the juke joint
Marty smiled at Squire pleasantly and said There was a cab waiting for me here Do you know where it might have gone
Squire chewed his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm He looked straight at Marty He did not answer Marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him looked into their staring eyes
Did anyone see my cab He asked keeping his voice casual
He avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him
I have to get back to Jarrodsville he went on I see there are some cars here I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town be happy to pay for the favor of course
The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer And then a startling thing occurred It was so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened
There was no word spoken no apparent signal given
Yet the men all moved at the same instant
They piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars sped off
The station wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville The Ford and the pickup truck sped west toward Sanford's Run
In seconds all four cars were out of sight
Marty Land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again From a great distance thunder growled and broke the silence
Land looked back toward the dilapidated house He thought he saw a pale face at a window Perhaps it was Dora May Perhaps she would be glad that they hurt him
There were other farmhouses nearby Across the road there was one no more than a hundred yards away There was another on this side a little further down There were many more between here and Jarrodsville Telephone poles lined the road They reared tall and mocking Their wires stretched out into infinity Not a single strand of wire reached into the silent houses beside the red-clay road
There was nothing he could do but walk And Jarrodsville was more than three miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire
Marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road After he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mud-caked The viscous mud was ankle-deep and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light
As he approached the first farmhouse thunder sounded behind him again closer now and louder like a steadily advancing drum corps There were several people on the porch of the farmhouse There was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town Then he realized the utter futility of the idea They were staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared Even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious
On his side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning against a plow They too stared at him
The drums of thunder were right behind him now
A foolish thought came into his head He remembered a story he had read as a youth It was probably one of Kipling's tales of the British Army It concerned an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out The steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded and each man about-faced and turned his back as the officer approached Marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs
The fencing by the roadside ended Now the dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic star The day's rain had been added to the stagnant water He was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car It was coming toward him The car was now in sight Marty's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it It was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm Acey Squire's station wagon It had headed back toward Jarrodsville That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out
The station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him beside a fenced field Then there was another sound A second car was coming from the west from the direction of Sanford's Run It was the Ford that had been outside Burch's farm
Marty looked helplessly in both directions It was a narrow road barely wide enough for two cars to pass He could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch When the two cars were equidistant from him the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered speed They bore down on him There was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch
He jumped and sank to his knees in muddy water
As the two cars roared by there was a high-pitched eerie nerve-shattering sound Marty knew how the Union soldiers must have felt at Chancellorsville and Antietam and Gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they called the Rebel yell
For moments he stood in water shivering and gasping for breath He had turned his ankle slightly and it pained him The cars with their load of howling men had disappeared in the distance There had been two more cars parked at the farm a Plymouth and a pickup truck They would be coming for him next bearing down on him from both directions And then the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again He would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to Jarrodsville He still had three miles to go Back East the more affluent juvenile delinquents who could afford hyped-up autos instead of switch blades as lethal weapons played this same game and called it Chicken
He could not go through the fields That way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence He had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence the section by the farmhouse At least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again The Admassy place could not be far now He would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest There was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected
He did not dare climb back up to the road He was deep in water but at least they could not reach him there He splashed on mud sucking at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm He climbed back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted He stood panting for a moment And then he saw something that he had not seen before and panic gripped him again
The fence his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it He lurched on down the road despairingly because there was no place else to go
He lost all sense of dignity You could not stand on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your life was at stake Probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse too but he did not bother to look He broke into a dogtrot breathing heavily streaming with sweat He had to reach Admassy's place It was his only sanctuary The fences on both sides of the road bristled with the barbed wire The fences stretched on endlessly
And then he heard them
And now he saw them
The Plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west They had timed it better this time They would reach him at almost exactly the same instant He stopped stone-still If he backed against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he would be cruelly lacerated by the wire
He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect target
The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards They were coming on at reckless speed for such old vehicles They thundered at him He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible When the Plymouth neared it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down He forced himself to stay frozen there If he moved he would be in the path of the other car He thought the fender of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by In a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side
The weird insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills
He did not leave the middle of the road He did not try to run He trudged on his aching eyes focused straight ahead He was nearing the Admassy house He was going to make it he told himself And then he heard a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and weep
Oh no not again he said aloud Not again so soon
There was a new sound a sound as piercing as the Rebel yell yet different It was the sound of a siren Now he saw that the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms frantically It was the prowl car from the sheriff's office
The car drew up alongside him and stopped
Get in Charley Estes said brusquely
He staggered into the back seat and lay back fighting for breath There was someone in front with the sheriff It was Pete Holmes the cabdriver
Pete turned around and said to Marty I guess you think a yellow-bellied hound But there no use in me staying there I fight a dozen or so of 'em If stayed all that have got was four punctured tires and one busted head Why you wait at the Burch house You known gone to get the sheriff I was lucky they let me go I guess
The sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space When it was finally pointed east he said You should never have come out here alone This is redneck country Every man in every one of these houses is a Night Rider

Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes Rourke was talking on the phone when he came back About an hour eh Are you positive He listened a moment and then said Hold it He turned his head and said Alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the Jai Alai Club on South Beach within an hour Want to try and meet him there
Shayne looked at his watch That too far from Fifth Street and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight He said with satisfaction fine Tim be there
Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up I know what getting into Mike he said unhappily I hope to Christ
Shayne said briskly Grab another drink if you want it got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez
Where
out in the Northeast section Have you got my car here
parked in front Rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes
better keep on driving yours Shayne decided because be going on over to the Beach I can drop you back here to pick mine up He went to a closet to get a light jacket and took his hat from beside the door Timothy Rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him asking Who are we going to call on in the Northeast section
A lady That is maybe not too much of a lady At least I want to find out whether home yet or not He opened the door and followed Rourke out
In Rourke's car Shayne drove east to Biscayne Boulevard and north toward Felice Perrin's address which had been given to him by the Peralta governess As he drove he filled in Timothy Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the Peralta house and on his own surmises
I want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone call there he ended grimly I know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but I want to see who takes the call
This deal at Las Putas Buenas where the two knife-men jumped you said Rourke with interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious Mrs. Peralta it
It does Shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green Jungle parking lot That story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony If it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written before Peralta ever called me in on the case
Do you think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's knowledge
I the faintest idea I think her husband strongly suspects so and why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so this Felice's street Shayne asked peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign
Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side and he said yes Turn to the left I think for that number you gave me Not more than a block or so
Shayne got in the left-hand lane and cut across the Boulevard divider There was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments
Shayne drove westward from the Boulevard slowly letting Rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers A single automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed indicating that it was occupied
He turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said the next house Mike On the right
Instead of pulling into the curb Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left He went around the corner and parked turning off his lights and motor
I told you Mike said Rourke in an aggrieved voice It was back there
Shayne said I know it was Tim His voice was chilling and cold Did you see the car parked across the street
I notice it I was watching for numbers
It has a Beach license Tim Two men in the front seat I got a quick look at their faces as we went past Unless crazy as hell two of Painter's dicks A couple named Harris and Geely Those names mean anything to you
Wait a minute Mike In Painter's office this evening
Shayne nodded grimly The pair whom Petey is officially commending for slapping me around and pulling me in
What are they doing here
A stake-out I suppose On Felice Perrin Maybe with specific orders to see that I make contact with her not positive Tim I may be wrong slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on Biscayne You drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there a reporter and looking for Miss Perrin to interview her Make them show their hands If they are Beach cops on a stake-out admit it to a reporter got no official standing on this side of the Bay As soon as you find out if they are Geely and Harris come on around to the lounge where be waiting
Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out Timothy Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel The things you talk me into Mike
Shayne chuckled How often do they add up to headlines You should complain
He crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant
He was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when Rourke came in six or eight minutes later The reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar Shayne told the bartender Bourbon and water and Rourke told him those two all right Harris and Geely I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin
Shayne said happily got it all worked out Tim Take your time with your drink beat it In exactly three minutes go in that phone booth behind you and call Police Headquarters Be excited and identify yourself Just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address be waiting for you there
The bartender brought Rourke's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar He said in a low voice got a date with a lady Mister Will that pay for a pint I can take with me You know how it is he added with a conspiratorial wink Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker and you have any candy for sale here anyhow
We sure The bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne
As the detective slid it into his pocket Rourke asked sadly What in hell are you going to do Mike
Make a couple of punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God stayed out of my way this afternoon Three minutes Tim
Shayne strode out blithely and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police
Outside Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south He walked over to the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket He hoped he be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives but its weight was comforting at his hip On this side of the Bay Miami Beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and Shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs
He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat He tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side
The big paunchy man named Geely was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door
Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night
Geely grunted and slid partly out and Shayne's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten up
Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster somewhat impeded by the steering wheel
Shayne locked his big hands around Harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp He dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from Geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side He stir They were both breathing heavily out cold and Shayne think either of them had recognized him or could describe him
He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat
He turned then to look toward the lighted Boulevard and saw Rourke's tall emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side
Shayne strolled across to intercept the reporter in front of the two-story house where Felice Perrin lived and asked casually Get the police okay
Sure Said have a patrol car here fast get inside What happened with you
Why the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out cold Shayne said good-humoredly have fun explaining that to the Miami cops Got no business over here on a stake-out anyway
They went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them Shayne found one marked Perrin Aj
The stairway on the right was dark but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top and they went up
There were two front rooms both dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake

Eight nine steps above him Roberts had paused Mickey paused with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out do a little planning He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set
If I could call in they could check the story while we were on our way I have to tell them I had Roberts
Then he heard it like a muffled thud felt a subtle change in air pressure He glanced up in time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above literally flying through the air his bloody face twisted Mickey tried to flatten against the banister gripped it with one hand but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin He gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail He tumbled with Roberts helpless and in agony over and over down the steps
By a wrenching effort he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head He was fuzzy in his mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of the weight of Roberts' body When his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward reaching Mickey was on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand
Mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack He rose stiffly forcing his knees to lock The knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again He made himself back off slowly his eyes wary on Roberts who now had no more to lose than he The pain dulled as he moved and he steadied inside After a moment he extended one hand the fingers curled
Come on he said You want to be that big a fool I was hoping for this
Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps He held the razor well out to one side He was invulnerable to attack but he could be handled Mickey knew if he could be brought to make the first move
They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step Mickey waited with slack arms
Any time Roberts he said Or would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets
The taunt was lost on Roberts He advanced slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side He was just short of arm's reach when he stopped Mickey backed off two steps forcing him to come on again There was a fixed grin on Roberts' face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood
Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated then came along They moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts a macabre dance two steps back two steps forward two steps back Mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door This was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if Roberts should feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern
The kick came sudden and vicious but short Mickey's guts twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon It moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward He hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly Ducking Mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood floor Then Roberts was on him gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade He felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs He got a knee up into Roberts' belly used both hands and heaved him clear then scrambled to his feet They were in the center of the lobby now Still clutching the razor Roberts came up into a crouch shaking his head When he charged Mickey was ready He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled in mid-air With his right fist and nearly all his weight behind it he smashed at the bloodstained face
Roberts careened backward his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate sudden-end sound He fell on his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still
Mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands panting for breath After a minute he went to Roberts looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse He feel any Roberts appeared to be dead if not yet then soon very soon Suddenly it was cold in the lobby
12 It seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do Actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this
no way to take him in now and keep those other two Wister and the one who hired the two of them from finding out about Roberts and lamming out The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home and maybe more than that They would have to By then they could never catch up with the others no other way have to do it myself
He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step Mickey was sure now he was dead
One thing he thought nobody knows about it yet Only me
He climbed the stairs went into Roberts' room found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could He left a few things It have to be perfect Roberts was a wastrel Walking away on impulse he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry
When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched It took him nearly an hour He went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door went outside and walked back to the garage He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing It snowed softly silently an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky He could feel it on his face and in his hair
He found the key to the Jeep got it started and warmed it up for five minutes Then he backed out and swung around to the front drive He went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat Then he went back for Roberts
The body was heavier than he had anticipated He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep He dumped it into the back and made sure it roll out then returned to the porch and closed the front door making sure it was unlocked
He drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier It snowed continuously but quietly evenly When he reached the dip in the woods he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground He drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine He parked facing it and left the headlights on but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase he found the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage He went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it When the dust settled he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder
It like carrying the suitcase The soft snow was deceitful underfoot Twice he nearly fell Inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden By the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight
He stood looking down for a few seconds then backed up two or three paces from the edge There was too much weight casually to toss it away He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out It would be a bad place to die It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up but Roberts had asked for it It was too late to worry about that
He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel It was a relief to get rid of the weight He was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off He gave it a strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor
Deep enough he decided There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter The external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next day It cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact By spring it would be a skeleton
He made his way back to the Jeep He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket He climbed down went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel
In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off using an oiled rag he found on a nail He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep He replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed got into his own car and backed it out of the garage There were tire marks where it had been but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny Liz Peabody he thought might spend some time grieving for her lost lover but he doubted that she would launch an investigation He judged her to be a woman of some pride though not much sense Still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently had run away

He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room The maid answered and he decided Nancy must be at work
Jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and then ignoring his own advice said excitedly But it does sound good A woman named Lisa who tells nobody anything about herself That courtyard picture with the same initials
not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm call you in a day or so
On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast
Gulf Springs was ten miles inland more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions
He checked into a motel and drove downtown The courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome Instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist's grass
He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff Carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office
Seated in front of the desk Hank said looking for some information with very little to go on Sheriff
He explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to Gulf Springs
The sheriff's swivel chair tilted back So looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned If there was such a person afraid she got away with it Pity we know more about him I think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later be a tedious job but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisor's office
Maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride
an idea Mrs. Calhoun has been society editor here for twenty-five years The editor says that marriages may be made in heaven but weddings are made in Mrs. Calhoun's columns the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that He smiled Once when the editor was just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation Mrs. Calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment also remember if the groom died later He stood up I wish you good luck but please dig up too tough a case for me this close to election If you find out anything come on back here and get started on it
Tracking down Mrs. Calhoun was like trying to catch up with Paul Revere between Lexington and Concord It turned out that she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance The wearying trek stretched into the afternoon from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found her at five o'clock
She was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter It took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted
Last year Well I do remember one From Baton Rouge Married a man named Vincent Black I remember her because she want her picture in the paper First bride like that seen in twenty-five years
What reason did she give
Said she had a breaking-out on her face some sort of allergy and none of her old pictures was good enough I see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked like it had never had a blemish on it But of course you see too well through the veil
Was her name Lisa Carmody
Now how in hell would I remember that
Never mind I can look it up Do they still live here
I think they moved away shortly after they were married He was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred sure be in the files We usually run a social note when somebody moves away
He stood up and thanked her
Have they inherited some money or something She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye
He said vaguely Well it is a little legal matter but nothing like that
He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving
Sounds like what after he said when Hank had finished Come on hurry down before they lock up for the day
In the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves
Mr. Ferrell Hirey Lindsay chairman of the board of supervisors Mr. Ferrell is a private detective Hirey Wants to look up something in the newspaper files so lock him in here
Sure said Hirey just leave the door open It latches when you close it so stay as long as you like
Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half He pulled it open Now shut this door It open from inside Before we built the new jail we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded Hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners They were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from Hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille
He walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls A metal table and four chairs stood in the center
all here back to 1865 Carruthers told him all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave And of course you know not to take clippings
leave the air conditioner on for you Mr. Ferrell said Hirey forget to turn it off and close the door good so latch
Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules When they had gone he stood for a minute breathing in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner quite dispel
Chapter fourteen In a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room An old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him
It was indeed all here almost a century From reconstruction to moon rockets But he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones
Last year's volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf He pulled it over climbed up and lifted out the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it He staggered over and dropped it on the table
Since Mrs. Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started to plod through several months He tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him At last he found it in the paper of April 2
It told him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered stating that it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others
There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom Mr. Black's life was an open book so to speak from his birth in Jackson Mississippi through his basketball-playing days at L.S.U. and his attainment of a B.A. degree which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for Peerless Business Machines
The one line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge No mention of New Orleans
Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr. Black If Mrs. Black was who he thought she was Mr. Black's Peerless selling days might well be over
Now for their exodus from Gulf Springs This time the search took twice as long cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue He found it in the edition of May 15 The item said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson his home town so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago
Next on his program was a call to the Jackson office of Peerless Business Machines to find out if Vincent Black was still with them or more specifically still with us
He glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided to indulge his weakness now For the next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen McKinley's assassination the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago and the Hall-Mills trial
In the middle of the stock market crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office He turned around saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse Something else distracted him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence Then he knew it was not sound but lack of it The air conditioner was no longer running
He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing It clanged shut as he sprang toward it
He pressed his face against the grille there
The light shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond enough for him to see there was no one there Then he heard the outer door closing
Hey come back he shouted He thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up
Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind Unless he was stone-blind the person just left have missed seeing Hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room And even if somehow missed seeing him he have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room
Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted But why To search his room at the motel To come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left No they could kill him just as easy right now Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault
Then he heard it and smelled it the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors' office
Until now Lilac Gaylor and Lila Kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing
Except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality Gaylor's obsession and Cunningham's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking of Lila and Lilac separately or together as a legend They kept drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide

Well said Mr. Skyros I take a little time to think it over It was awkward very awkward There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over Someone reasonably trustworthy And Angie would hear about it And Angie knew
Time said Angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros Not too much time because be needing some more myself pretty much right away And I done favors for you big favor not so long back I and right here to take on where Pretty left off No trouble I want no trouble you want no trouble nobody wants trouble Mr. Skyros
Dear heaven no thought Mr. Skyros turning away as another man came in He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand the genial smile seemed painted on his face Angie knew Speak of dangerous information Angie knew too much entirely already Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay
Big favor I done you Acourse this deal o' Denny's and Jackie's kinda hangin' fire it maybe been kinda worryin' over that And say I blame you said Angie thoughtfully This deal with the ace o' spades Anything to do with an ace o' spades bad luck
Ace of spades a widow that was what they called a widow these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly All about that Angie knew too When things got a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand it seemed to be a general rule All just by chance and in a way tracing back to poor Frank all of it because naturally brothers living together and Angie
Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo's regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking face or indeed anything about Angelo Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles he found money much more interesting but all the same he thought now uneasily of the way in which Angelo earned his living and paid for his own stuff and eyed the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eyes and he felt a little ill
Look my friend he said in my life I learn how is it the proverb says better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure I stay in business so long because careful Two weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal it
a long while said Angie I tell you you want to leave it that way I fool around with it I go over to Castro and get fixed up there I wait no two weeks
And Mr. Skyros like Angie but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely to come out And Angie such a valuable salesman Prettyman said All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys Why did everything have to happen at once
Denny said stupidly Why you turning Angie down are you Mr. Skyros I mean we all figured I guess figure Angie
Angelo gave him an affectionate smile Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me he said O.K. Denny O.K. it Mr. Skyros
Oh God the name repeated over and over anybody to hear Not being a fool Mr. Skyros knew why But aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held you could say the whip hand And all because of Domokous If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause
Of course there was another factor Angie worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes went down fast Who knew Angie might not last long The sweat broke out on Mr. Skyros' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking hoping planning perhaps
Good God above had not Domokous been enough
He patted Angelo's thin shoulder paternally Now you want to go talking that way he said Sure sure the one take over for Pretty soon as I get the supply get started up again it You need worry Angelo I tell you I know how it is with you my friend I sympathize and make it a special point a special favor get in touch and get some stuff just for you I know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow but try my best my friend You see you got to remember we all got schedules like any business My man he be around a little while he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite awkward you see that it
Well your business Mr. Skyros said Angie and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window I appreciate it you do that Sure We none of us want no trouble in a room over the Golden Club on San Pedro you just ask for me there you want see me Or maybe I call you tonight About nine o'clock I call and see if you got any A couple decks for me Mr. Skyros and ten-twelve to sell see I like to have a little ready cash

Sure said Angie Sure Mr. Skyros Fifty a throw that the deal Sure I bring you the cash say five hundred for ten decks Never mind how much I cut it how much I get and he smiled his sleepy smile again Standard deal Mr. Skyros You go 'n' have a look round for it
I do my best said Mr. Skyros earnestly just for you my friend This is awkward for everybody it we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes But I do my best for you He got out of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping his brow
The expedient thing yes very true one must make do as one could in some situations It could all be straightened out later Not very much later but when things had settled down a little After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through An ace of spades He was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that indeed He rather wished he had never got into the business and still scarcely to be resisted a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money
Katya Roslev who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks Usually she marked the few who did thank you you get that kind much in a place like this and she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she could act to the others before take offense threaten to call the manager Funny how seldom they did used to it probably The kind who came into a cheap store like this Grab snatch I saw that first And Here take this I was before her you wait on me now or I bother with it see This kind of place
be through here just no time at all leave this kind of thing 'way behind Off at noon and never come back Never have to Money a lot of money enough be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect maybe get it until Monday account of that the banks But that really long to wait Not when waited so long already
No need say anything at all to the old woman She had it all planned out how do say she feel good on Sunday go to church be a little argument but she could be stubborn and when the old woman had gone quick pack the things need to take all but the dress wear Monday and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for a dime Then on Monday morning or it might have to be Tuesday get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer She be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left go do the daily shopping No need leave a note with it either or maybe just something like worry about me going away to make a better life
A better life Escape It as if she wanted much She mind working hard not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft all she wanted was a chance where she marked as what she was To be Katharine Ross and work in a nicer shop somewhere at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes and learn ladies' manners and all like that and get to know different people than up to now not just the ones like her here with foreign-sounding names the ones went to the same church and Different place different job different people be all different too Prettier do her hair another way smarter and wear different kinds of clothes be Katharine Ross just what that sounded like
give me the wrong change said the customer sharply Think I count
Katya made up the amount in indifferent silence She was listening to other voices out of the future Some of those vaguely-imagined new different people Oh awfully nice and pretty too I like Katharine ask Katharine to go with us always lots of fun Katharine
Soon very soon now
sixteen Mendoza wake until nearly nine-thirty It was going to be another hot day already the thermometer stood close to ninety Alison was still sound asleep he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly of face powder He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today and drove home
After got out fresh liver for Bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish Surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens Y que sigue despues What then He asked her severely A lot of people are so peculiar that they like cats not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens and damn it you know very well if I have them around long impossible to give them away And I suppose now that finally grown up if a little late go on producing kittens every six months or so Yes well a pity to spoil your girlish figure which all those kittens would do anyway but I think when raised these just have the vet fix it so there be any more I wonder if the Carters would take one And no good looking at me like that as she wound affectionately around his ankles

Maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up Happened to be in the hall Happened to hear you quarrel about her Oh well you really blame Lolotte She lost her beau to you
But she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door Sarah remembered it clearly Maude went on got to get busy Miss taken to her bed with the door locked She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you Here She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah's hand Not that much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now Drink your coffee
coffee cold Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat I want it Sarah said firmly
Oh Well take it down with me as I go
Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start At the door she turned back her Roman nose looking very long now and satiric I forgot Ben and Lucien have gone after them just like that book your Northern friend wrote except there any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds
I know Mrs. Stowe What can they do if they find them
They do anything silly childish running after them like that I told Ben so But of course the paterollers be of any help not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around God knows where
She had swished away she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it But then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but undrinkable especially that cup
She was deeply horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium She had quarreled with Lucien she had resisted his demands for money and if she died by the provisions of her marriage contract Lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office but later when the war was over her father's entire estate
She felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time Now wait a minute she told herself think about it Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee
She had lost a bottle of opium but that was on the trip from New Orleans Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa Yes she had missed it after her talk with Emile after dinner just before Emile was shot Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing back her washed clothes So somebody else could have come in too then or later while she was out of the room It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor
It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her He even know that she was there And he certainly have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding yes and credible fool he had every right to expect No he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised
Then somebody else question Rev had said invite danger Her skin crawled Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall So Lolotte or anybody could have listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium
That was not reasonable either The opium had disappeared before Emile's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah's own doubts and suspicions and questions
She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave Honotassa
That made a certain amount of logic Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by its taste
No It was merely an attempt to frighten her
She go back to New York as Maude suggested she run like a scared cat But well be very careful
She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life
But before she left her room she dug into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died
Rev had known all along Rev need to break the wax seal read the contract and find out He could conceivably have wished to make sure Rev loved Honotassa it was like a part of his breath and body Rev had stressed the need for money Rev would never have tried to give her poison
She thrust the envelope back in the bag there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen And in all likelihood by now there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool been
She went downstairs and received another curious shock for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she Too much work this morning Miss Sarah everybody gone like that
Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat Well then who brought it
Miss Maude She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice Not much breakfast this morning I know what going to do Miss Sarah
got to eat Sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her again Maude
Glendora flapped away The rice dosed with opium indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt She ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway with the rain dripping from the vines In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens Get a basket Sarah told her go to the storehouse
Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers and went with her through the drizzle to the storehouse Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door
It was a long low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines had run rampant over that too It was dark but dry and cool She doled out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas eggs cornmeal a little salt The shelves looked emptier than when Miss Celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from the Commissary had called there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with She took Glendora to the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon hanging from the smoke-stained rafters
They go hungry not yet And the fields were green and growing you possibly imagine what life is going to be like here Maude had said
Maude
She sent Glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden She stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head thinking of Maude
Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do She see how her death could affect Maude She see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her Besides there was something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish
Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York Maude could have shot Emile if had a reason to kill him
There was no use in standing there in the drizzle trying to find a link between Emile's murder and opium in a cup of coffee
She started back for the house saw a light in the office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder Rev George and Lolotte were mending shoes
A lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky drizzling day They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot George had a tack hammer Lolotte held a patch of leather Rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for George's poised hammer George said First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again is get me a Yankee
With boots on Lolotte laughed softly
Rev looked up and saw her Lolotte looked up and stiffened George look up at all There was no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah's appearance believing her to be drugged and senseless and just possibly dead
Rev said Come in Sarah Reckon you know the news
And what news Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it
Rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning He turned to George and Lolotte Take your cobbler's shop somewhere else I want to talk to Sarah
Everything in the office the spreading circle of lamplight the patch of leather in Lolotte's hands George poised with the tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt at murder A rush of panic caught Sarah No Not now I mean got to to see to the kitchen Glendora
Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev's face
Now why did I do that She thought as warm drizzling rain touched her face She was no schoolgirl refusing to bear tales
As she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien her husband
It might be indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love but it was marriage So she choose Rev as a confidant it must be Lucien
Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought as coldly and sharply again as Maude might have said it
She paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning lamp chimneys Glendora gave a gulp Miss Sarah I cut up no chicken Miss Maude say she
Again the homely everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her or to murder her
The homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency No matter what had happened or happened somebody had to see about dinner She eyed the chickens with if she had known it something of Glendora's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs

Not since last night I think there was any reason to
Maybe there Speak to him again anyway Try talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone Try to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with women You might try looking into his wife too She might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if been having any trouble
You think the one looking for
Yeah I think he might be Conrad said grimly Then again he might not
What a stinking world Rourke said Black is Gilborn's best friend
I know
Will you be coming back soon
I think so on my way to see the Jacobs woman
Gilborn's secretary What for You think Gilborn is the
I think anything I just want to go off half-cocked before picking up Black all Conrad interrupted Gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday like to make sure Also just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn
Right see you later
you ever going to go home
It sure as hell look like it does it telling you if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to think twice before letting themselves get knocked off
Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet
Conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench massaging his right leg
He looked at his watch It was ten minutes before eleven
He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from Lionel Black
Thirty years' experience let him know even at this early stage that Black was his man
But he still wanted to know why
It was a cold windy day the day after Kitti's death but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery October wind
After leaving Conrad Gilborn had no destination He simply walked not noticing where he was not caring He stopped automatically at the street corners waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his coat open and flapping
As he walked he tried to think
Of Kitti Of himself Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make him believe
There was nothing coherent about his thinking It was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind the same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession
The enormity of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality of it
Conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only Emotionally they penetrated him not at all
Whoever he was and your wife were intimate
Gilborn remembered Conrad's exact words They made sense and yet they He knew Conrad had told him the truth It was so Yet it so It so because it be so
When Kitti was alive and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm she had been the center of his life
She was the sun he the closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed
For fifty-five years he had lived progressing towards a no-goal eating working breathing without plan without reason
Kitti had come along to justify everything She was his goal she was his reason He had lived all his life waiting for her
Not once in the time that he had known her had he ever considered the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth of a second of her infidelity
He could not consider it now Not really And so he walked aimless again
The walk ended inevitably right in front of his hotel building The doorman began to nod his head automatically then remembered who Gilborn was what had happened to him the night before He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity
Gilborn passed by him without seeing him
He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts
In the apartment itself all was still The police were no longer there There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been
Except that Kitti there
Without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door
At last sitting there in the familiar surroundings the truth began to sink in
Who
He felt no anger towards Kitti no sense that she had betrayed him
Who
She was all he had everything he had everything he wanted Someone had taken her away from him
Who
Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger there is a right-hand one he remembered from his school days
Where there is a victim there is a killer
Who
Whoever he was and your wife were intimate
He rose from the chair took off his coat Quickly he went into the bedroom
The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain Gilborn stood there for a long time He looked at the bed unblinkingly
The bed was empty now Kitti would lie in it no more He would lie in it no more
Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who
For thirty minutes Stanley Gilborn stood there
At the end of the half-hour racking his brains thinking over and over again of Kitti her friends her past he left the bedroom
Who
He could think of no answer
Gilborn put on his coat again Before leaving he took one last lingering look at the apartment
He knew he would never see it again
In the street walking as quickly as he could Stanley Gilborn was a lone figure
On Blanche Jacobs Kitti Gilborn's death had a quite different effect For Blanche Kitti's death was a source of guilty but nonetheless soaring happy hope
In Blanche's defense it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope
If anyone had asked her she would have described herself only as nervous and worried The figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter
She wondered whether Stanley would call She wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed
She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out He And now she was feeling sick both from concern about Stanley and hunger
Why he called
Men she reflected even men like Stanley are unpredictable
She tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they so many after all
Stanley really was quite predictable That was one of the things she liked about Stanley He like so many other men The dentist last night for instance Dinner and the movies had been fine He had taken her upstairs to say good night She had invited him in for coffee
It was in the kitchen as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that he had grabbed for her Without warning without giving her a chance to prepare for it From behind he had put his arms on her shoulders turned her around and pressed her to him so close she breathe
Later she apologized for the long scratch across his face tried to explain she help herself that the panic arose in her unwanted But he understood When he left she knew she would never see him again
Stanley like that She could always predict what Stanley was going to do ever since she first met him
Except for that one morning The morning he walked in to announce to her blushing that he was married She thought she was going to die
She had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him
Blanche remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion She thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for Stanley It was nothing that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal
She was thirty-one years old then Her mother was already considerably concerned over her daughter's future But Blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother's continued carping had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony
For Blanche it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose It was to be expected that Stanley would be shy slow in taking such a momentous step Stanley went along in life she knew convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman As a result he never looked for it
But one day she expected he would somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such a woman in the world a woman who was willing to give him love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband Indeed there was a woman who unasked had already given him love Unquestionably Blanche loved Stanley
And then unexpectedly Stanley made his announcement
On that first day Blanche literally thought she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind
It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker been everything that Blanche was not
Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley taller than Stanley prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for much less expect Kitti could have married a score of men There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn there was no need for her to marry Stanley
Kitti had come into the office on somebody's recommendation because she needed help in preparing her income tax return
Stanley had filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close to the lunch hour he had politely asked Kitti to join him never expecting her to accept
Blanche knew all this because the door to Stanley's office was open and without straining too hard she could hear everything that was said
Stanley had gone out saying he would be back in an hour He come back for over two
After that day Blanche still know exactly what had happened There were mornings when Stanley came in late afternoons when he left early days when he come in at all
Blanche knew something must be causing Stanley's new strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker It was too unprecedented Then six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office Stanley announced he and Kitti were married
Somehow Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations
That night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon in Acapulco
While they were away Blanche came into the office every morning running things as she had always run them for Stanley going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically out of habit
For exactly one week she was able to continue in this manner
On the morning of Stanley's return however her strength left her Two hours of watching his serenely happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures and Blanche had to leave
She stayed away for ten days Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known
Mostly she stayed in bed She tell anyone even her mother what was wrong She refused to have a doctor insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her

Right said the fingerprint man Also if going to believe those prints have to look for a killer a top-grade piano player
He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack To make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change of manner the killing of Rose Mallory His hands snatched at an imaginary bucket swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball been bounced hard In the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that He was moving like a ballet dancer playing for laughs If Rose Mallory's killer acted this way catching up with him was going to be a cinch know him by his stretch pants and the flowers wear twined in his hair
Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness This you will remember was still New Year's Day By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon which one would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats
Felix was the exception He had retained his hat and his horn and whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it That incidentally might give you some idea of what Felix was like After all he happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning
The M.E.'s boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy The meat wagon therefore was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings There was furthermore the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance
Just put yourself in Felix's place for a moment a taxpayer householder landlord been away from home for the New Year festivities but now the party is over and you come home Defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober
You still have your paper hat and wearing it but then it is an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else you may be you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr. Average Citizen
You have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants You find your house a focus of public and police attention Can you imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn
Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness You shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door You identify yourself and ask him going on Instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs
Got the upstairs guy he bellows The owner Do I send him up Then he turns back to you Go on in he says tell you cooking
Even then as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable official control could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand
What getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix's being an odd one seen his handiwork out in the back yard and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a little special We were not however prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs He of course must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him but nonetheless I did find his reaction startling
If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because forgotten about them he now remembered He came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance He adjusted the hat lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him
Our man stopped dead and glowered at Felix Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house This was a bull of a man He was big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed His face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown I remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures His hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short It was almost as white as his teeth For a man of his mass he was curiously short He a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure A man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five For Felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement The man was just this side of being a freak
We waited till he had finished laughing and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend Dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel shirt black silk necktie His eyes were clear He was freshly shaved and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter Not even a whiff Eventually he subsided
Felix Gibby said
Me he said merrily Me the happy one
That much Latin we remember Gibby said dryly You always live up to your name always like this always making happy
I try Felix said blithely The world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene never noticed that it improves things any
Bully for you Gibby said the rest of your name
No rest of it Felix is all there is
All there ever was
The past I leave to historians Felix intoned demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy
You live in the present
In the present Felix proclaimed For the future Is there any other time in which a man can live
We Gibby announced are not philosophers We are Assistant District Attorneys This gentleman is a police officer He is a fingerprint specialist Could your future your immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him your finger tips
The happy one could never have looked happier This was more than joy It was ecstasy
Those lovely whorls he chortled So intricate so beautiful Come right along I love fingerprints
He was prancing along the hall heading for the next flight of stairs
Gibby called him back here because of what happened last night he said Past yes but important Since it is important for the record have the full name
That important Felix asked
That important
Grubb Felix whispered
Felix Grubb Gibby asked not bothering to whisper
Shh Felix implored I see what would make it necessary for you to know Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world
Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice Felix Grubb He repeated No Edmund but not for years For years been just Felix First thing I did after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially changed and this is something I tell everybody That was almost forty years ago
Having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible This was a broth of a boy our Felix and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit We followed him up the stairs The cops would gather up Connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting
You may think we need Nancy and Jean but you always get what you can when you can and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them be useful before we were through with this case Also if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood The killer if in our present group would certainly be interested in knowing that much and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation there might always be some way If you can possibly avoid it you hand out any extra chances
Felix took us into his studio It was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope At each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades
When Felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night He quickly fixed that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others He flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience None of his movements was tentative There was no process of trial and error Starting with the room completely blacked out as it was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare
Expecting something more-than-average wacky I was surprised by what we found There was no display of either works in progress or of finished work Here and there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it These shapes might have been mad but there was no telling They were all completely shrouded The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort convenience and efficiency There were tools about but they were neatly kept There was no confusion and no litter Supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins

Andy did not see the newspapers the next day Someone on his staff he suspected it was Ed Thornburg intercepted them and for this Andy was grateful
He finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used and awaken until early afternoon Memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach
Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also and those who had kidnapped him But where It was still a very big world despite all the modern cant to the contrary
Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door He was dozing perhaps the only sleep gotten He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance Sorry Mr. Paxton Nothing new Lot of people waiting to see you though

Our own people Questions about the show tonight Hub picked up the telephone Shall I let them know awake
I suppose Lissa do you know
Hub considered Some better got plenty of guts Mr. Paxton You want me to call her
She expecting me to Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted He could not manage the former or expect the latter they had nothing to give to each other The omission might look peculiar to outsiders but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances
He had little time to himself anyway As the afternoon sped toward evening the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out each with his own special problem Thornburg arrived with the writers They had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations What remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified as befitting the tragic circumstances Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed Cradle Song in case it was needed Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement they decided it was wise and later to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casino's open date And once Bake slipped in pale and drawn last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it He asked if there was anything he could do Andy invented a job to keep him busy sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements
But from Rocco Vecchio they heard nothing
At last it was time to depart Hub nosing about spotted reporters in the lobby so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel's service entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere
They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub El Dorado was surrounded by a mob They overflowed the parking lot making progress by automobile difficult Long before he reached the protection of the stage door Andy was recognized Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire They surged around him fingers pointing eyes prying It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night's hero-worshippers They had come not to admire but to observe
worse inside Thornburg informed Andy jammed in every table he could find Under the heading of an ill wind et cetera
Backstage was tomblike by contrast Andy's co-workers kept their distance awed by the tragedy But in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read with you all the way It was signed by everyone in the troupe Andy help but be touched He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board
Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment Bake himself looked better any kind of job was better than brooding
Andy told him Bake I wish talk to Skolman see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper able to get a table I want him to miss the message
try Skolman going to like it much though giving away what he should be selling
Skolman the only one who care for Andy's scheme A short time later Lieutenant Bonner stomped into the dressing room I got a bone to pick with you Mr. Paxton those damn loudspeakers
Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying What about them
going to louse me up good My men have been here all afternoon setting up for this thing Bonner explained that with the nightclub's cooperation the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield Motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead However it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose I want you to have the speakers taken out
Andy sighed Seems like never going to see eye to eye Lieutenant they tell you what I wanted the p. a. system for
Sure I know But such a long shot
No longer than yours What do you expect to get tonight anyway You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces Or have a sign on his car that says Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper Andy crumbled the script in his fist I stop you from doing what you think is right But try to stop me either
Someday Bonner said going to ask us for help I can hardly wait
What you understand is that asking for it now
But Bonner departed still full of ill will He had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination he had to cling to routine tested procedures To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness But admit or not Bonner was helpless The crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist
Andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock He stalled for a half-hour longer hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money Bake and Shirl Winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable location in Los Angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts
Bake cursed The sweaty probably halfway to Peru with our money by now When no one smiled he felt constrained to add Just kidding natch
Thornburg popped in to advise Andy Skolman's sending up smoke signals You about ready
he complaining about Bake asked drinking they
No We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard They act more like a jury than an audience
Andy said Well I guess we wait any longer Hub you stick by the stage door If Rock shows up during the number or you hear anything give me the signal
Shirl Winter said stay on the phone Mr. Paxton a couple of call-backs I can work on
a sweetheart but leave one line open He may try to phone us Andy passed into the corridor their good lucks Following him It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different as if he really needed it
They were right The act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone The result had nothing of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night where luck would normally step in But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge Twenty-four hours had changed him from a performer to a freak
Within this framework what followed was strained even macabre Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy The effect was as depressing as a gravestone the applause irresolute and short-lived Yet Andy plowed ahead mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and gradually his listeners warmed to him Their clapping grew more fervent the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for him as a person
The worst was yet to come
As Andy reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings Rocco Vecchio a perspiring haggard Vecchio was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held
Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief He waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction The music died away discordantly He drew a deep breath Ladies and gentlemen in place of my regular closing number tonight like to sing something of a different nature for you Ray if you please the Cradle Song
He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience Nor could he blame them This particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency Having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone for support
Lullaby and goodnight
His voice shook For the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest He wondered if the audience would let him finish
They did though contemptuous they were still polite But when he was finally through their scorn was made apparent Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped Otherwise the silence was complete As the lights came up Andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit
He stumbled off-stage My God he muttered My God
Hub was there to support him okay Mr. Paxton The here all of it
At this moment all he could think of was what been forced to undergo Did you hear them Do you know what they think of me
Bunch of damn jerks Hub growled Who needs them
Thornburg patted his arm Sure Andy be all right Nothing broken that be mended The words were hollow Thornburg knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty All the king's horses and all the king's men
Vecchio shouldered in I got it Andy God knows how but I got it never believe the places been today I practically had to sign your life away probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for but
Andy nodded dully It matter Rock done our part
He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent the place had the air of a morgue Andy had no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them

His son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of sight then hurried after Dad Dad wait
He caught up with the old man in the living room Old man Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door
Just this one favor Dad Just tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours
Why not The old man gave the room a stare in leaving under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory the truth
The Bartlett girl was killed by Mr. Dronk's son Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street talking to the kid found some sort of new evidence a bundle of clothes or something and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime Why you accept facts The two kids were together a lot they were having some kind of teen-age affair God knows how far that had gone and the crippled He limps and the man who hit you and took the cane he limped My God how much more do you want
His father looked him over closely You sound like an old woman You should have gone to work today 'stead of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house
Now see here
The trouble with you old man Arthur began and then checked himself Young Mrs. Arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits The old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight enough time to go into it he finished and slammed the door in his son's face
Mrs. Holden turned from the window draperies They found something else up there she said half-aloud to the empty room They took it away overalls or something She walked restlessly across the room then back to the windows Now gone they come back and they arrest that Dronk boy She stood frowning and chewing her lip She was wearing a brown cotton dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below She smoothed the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows Why on earth did I send him off to work There was excuse enough to keep him home that young Mr. still over there
With sudden energy she went to the phone and rang Holden's office and asked for him
I think you had better come home
Mae so busy Mr. been on everybody's neck an order he expected come through and
I care I want you here all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous I need someone to go out and find out happening
But I do that even if I were home His voice grew high and trembling I be underfoot every time those cops turn around think I did something
He see the grin that split her mouth the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark's just have to risk it You wander along in the dark can you think that you even more than I would be wondering what up to They found some clothes she tossed in
What
Deliberately she ignored the yelp Also that Mr. Ferguson was here I guess he wants to ask you some questions I stalled him off He expect you until five
Then better wait until five
No-o-o Come home right away She slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away Her eyes were bright with anticipation
In his office Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly He rose from his chair He had to cough then he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face He got his hat out of the closet For a moment he thought of going into Crosson's office to explain that he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a pounding in his head that he decided to let it go He passed the receptionist in the outer office muttering got to go out for a little while Let her call Crosson if she wanted to let Crosson raise the roof or even can him he care
He got into the car Putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body Once out in the street the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken When he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears
What on earth was in Mae's mind that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing What did she think he could do
He tried to ignore what his own common sense told him but it possible her motives were too blatant She wanted him to get into trouble She wanted the police to notice him suspect him She was going to keep on scheming poking prodding suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions And he knew in that moment with a cold sinking of despair a dying of old hopes that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors Nothing bald open but enough have some suspicions to repeat to the police
Though his inner thoughts cringed at it he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child
It amounted to anything There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions
A second scene flashed before his mind the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light
Suppose the cops somehow got hold of that
Well it been what it seemed had no idea the girl was in there He touched her
And when he came to examine the scene there was a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift suspicion darted into his mind
Too monstrous of course Mae have plotted a thing like that It was just that little accidents played into her hands Like this murder
He leaned on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring order into his thoughts He felt light-headed and sick There was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare Mae was his wife She was married to him for better or for worse She be wilfully planning his destruction
But she was She was
Even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake to head up the road for home doing her bidding He drove and the road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side He came to a stretch of old orange groves the trees dead some of them uprooted and then there was an outlying shopping area and tract houses He had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide But he imagine where There was really no place to go finally except home to Mae
At the gate he slowed looking around Cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just standing there morosely he even look up Behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur he was straight something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report something Holden stepped on the gas
A new idea drifted in from nowhere He could go to the police He could tell them his fears of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his own jerkings and snivelings and Ferguson's silent patience He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department
It what Mae would want him to do though He was sure of this Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense there be very much for Mae to do At that moment Holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about
It would be such a relief
What was that old sign supposed to be painted over a door somewhere Abandon hope all ye who enter here
Why Holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be worried lain awake nights shook at the slightest footstep pictured their own destruction and now all over and they can give up Sure giving up hope Hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension Good-bye Holden waved a hand at the empty street Glad to see you go
He drove into the paved space before the garage and got out slamming the car door He looked up and down the street If Ferguson's car had been in sight Holden would have walked directly to it
He went to the front door and opened it and looked in
Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen She had a cup of something steaming coffee perhaps in one hand a fresh piece of toast in the other She stood there watching Holden come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth
Mae
been thinking she said swallowing the toast you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage You used them that time you painted the porch at our other house And then you wiped up some grease
She had caught him off guard no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster No Wait a minute What do you
been looking for them and gone sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago Or even yesterday You used to paint in them and then you just took them for rags The police have them now
I remember any overalls at all
They were all faded Worn through at the knees She stood sipping and chewing and watching Green paint it Well not sure of the color But you had them
Mae sit down Put down the cup of coffee Tell me what this is all about
She shook her head She took another bite of toast Holden noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck My goodness you ought to remember if I do going to have to go to the police and explain what happened Tell them the truth or something before they come here
A seeping coldness entered Holden's being his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like liable to break like an icicle at any moment never owned any painting overalls

A man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said Is this more like it Mrs. MacReady Or are the eyebrows more like this When he had finished with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else most probably a busboy Begin to look like him now would you say Different about the mouth huh More like this maybe
Men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again and did the same in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the West Forties And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once more
Men from the Third Detective District Eighteenth Precinct had the longest the most tedious job At the Hotel Dumont there had at the time in issue been twenty-three overnighters counting couples as singular These included as one Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before and had not checked out together But Gardner Willings was not included he had been at the Dumont for almost a week There was of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel The twenty-three or twenty-two with the Paynes themselves omitted provided merely a place to start and their identification was the barest of starts With names and addresses listed verification came next It would take time it would almost inevitably trouble some water I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband have been in Boston Of course in
The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems The King Arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and want heaven knew want to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations to distant homes probably through rain or in November something worse The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont The King Arthur had fifty-four overnighters again counting rooms rather than people
Check the overnighters out Failing to find what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special but not exclusive attention to those with rooms on the street Anyone active enough can reach a roof wherever his room may be And know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel There were other roofs less convenient but not impossible It is dull business detecting and hard on feet
There was also the one salient question to ask and ask widely Did you notice anything out of the way Like for example a man carrying a twenty-two rifle probably with a telescopic sight attached
There was of course no hope it really would be that simple The sniper whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle Long thin suitcase Or long fat suitcase for that matter Shrugs met that from room clerks from bellhops Who measures But nothing it appeared long enough to attract attention Cases say for musical instruments None noted at the Dumont Several at the King Arthur A combo was staying there And had been for a week Anything else Anything at all Shrugs met that
Detective Pearson Eighteenth Precinct thought for a time he might be on to something A refuse bin at the Dumont turned up a florist's box a very long box for very long-stemmed flowers Traces of oil on green tissue The lab to check The lab sorry No oil
Anything at all strange
Well a man had tried at the King Arthur to register with an ocelot At the Dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair At the King Arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches There had also been a man who must have had St. Vitus or something because he kept jerking his head
As reports dribbled in William Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head Mullins came in There was no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on Nod Road Ridgefield Connecticut The house was modern large on five acres Must have cost plenty The State cops would check from time to time pass word when there was word to pass Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge Sort things out damn it Sort out the next move
Try to forget motive for the moment Consider opportunity Only those actually with Payne when he was shot or who had left the party within not more than five minutes make five arbitrary positively had none The Norths Hathaway Jerry's publicity director Livingston Birdwood producer of Uprising They had been with Payne when he was shot could not therefore have shot him from above
Take Gardner Willings He had left after the scuffle had been seen to leave He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey Consider him seriously therefore Intangibles entered then hunches which felt like facts Willings would ambush certainly Willings undoubtedly had Willings was presumably a better than average shot But hunch now Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four Because if for no other reason Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything else that went on two legs Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves as any man may against a tiger
Faith Constable had had to go on from the party and had presumably gone on To be checked out further Forget motive No motive is a part of fact Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind Faith Constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong Bill shook his head Also he thought I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun
Lauren herself She had left the party early pleading a headache No lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun She might conceivably have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase Check on the Payne luggage She might now have taken it away again Motive her husband wandering Bitter unreasoning jealousy Heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too But it happened almost always among the primitive and usually among the very young Call it mentally young call it retarded There was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive She did not move in primitive circles She was young but not that young
It occurred to Bill Weigand that he was on a hunch basis eliminating a good many He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities
The Masons mother or son or mother and son Opportunity was obvious Motive Here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years But bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode With the boy particularly The boy had apparently if Mrs. MacReady was right in what she had told Mullins only in recent months been forced to give up college to work as a busboy Seeing the man he blamed for this made much of youth and bitterness and
Bill picked up the telephone got Mullins
Send out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when got enough to go on Bill said Right
Mullins would do
A man named Lars Simon playwright-director had expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead He would say of course that he had not really had any such wish that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing Which probably would turn out to be true which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say
A man named Blaine Smythe with y and e but pronounced without them had been fired at Payne's insistence He was also if Pam North was right a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne's than she now was inclined to admit He might deny the latter would certainly deny any connection between the two things or any connection of either with murder He would have to be given the opportunity
Mullins It was evident that Mullins was the man to go It was evident that a captain should remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat Bill Weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack in the plaster Let Mullins keep the firm seat let Stein
When Siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins Stilts and Shadow on Pam's bed appeared to be one cat rather large as Siamese cats go and to be sure having two heads and two tails On the other hand they or it seemed to have no legs whatever Pamela North said Hi to her cats and added that proper cats met their humans at the door Of four dark brown ears one twitched slightly at this All right Pam said I know it dinnertime
But at this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats stretching Shadow the more talkative began at once to talk her voice piteous Stilts a more direct cat leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen Shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her The hell it dinnertime two waving tails told Pam North
It was not whatever tale was told by tails Martha presumably would cope She might be firm It was most unlikely that she would be firm They want to be fat cats Pam thought and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together After a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble A vague feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible Had Faith Constable's explanation of her confidence so uninvited been a little thin That was more like a thought but not a great deal more Had that tall dark boy carrying trays too heavy for him found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could bear And possessed himself how of a rifle and killed Pam found she had no answers had only a hope The poor kid the poor frail kid Some people have luck and some have no luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of it The poor unlucky
The telephone rang Pam realized to her surprise that she had been almost dozing At four o'clock in the afternoon Two martinis for lunch that was the trouble I ought to remember pretend You do remember You just Hello Yes this is she What
The voice had music in it Even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the voice
I said I would Pam said They talk about who gave the information Not unless they have to They Mrs. Constable Not unless they have
She was interrupted
Call this a cry for help Faith Constable said

Through a door conveniently unlocked Madden supplemented
That damn door said the police chief
A gift horse to be viewed with suspicion Madden's dark face wore a meditative look If there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later And it makes a very poor red herring for an inside job Much better to break a cellar window
forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death Pauling reminded him
Well with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation
Yeah And a pane of glass hard to
The telephone interrupted him He scooped up the receiver and said Police chief into the mouthpiece and then Oh yes Mr. Benson I was hoping hear from you today
With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying Uh-huh and I see at intervals
At last he said Well thank you for calling Mr. Benson Although there was no doubt in my mind and been handling it as one glad to have it made official
He hung up Coroner he said to Madden just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from suffocation Pauling looked at his notes Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils Scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities No other cause of death apparent Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects Brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage No signs of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach He paused about it Oh the time of death The duration of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that Mrs. Meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock dinner Probably around midnight give or take an hour either way
Pauling paused again So there it is he said Not your problem of course unless Johnston and the murderer are one and the same
They discussed this possibility However likely it was Pauling said he limit himself to it He had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light Madden with his investigation centered on the fraud said that tomorrow he would go to the Bronx bank through which Mrs. Meeker's checks to Johnston had cleared
Arthur Williams had to be located they agreed He might have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud he might be Mrs. Meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death This was Madden's suggestion the police chief shook his head over it If Arthur Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he too had another identity No one the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston
Scholarship applicant Pauling looked doubtful Madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs. Meeker Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian Thayer who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock
Madden said that he would see him at two and made another call this one to Mrs. Meeker's lawyers Mr. Hohlbein was out for the day but Mr. Garth would be free at one-thirty The secretary's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which Madden should be duly grateful
He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers
He had lunch with Pauling Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth's elegant suite of offices in Medfield's newest professional building
He disliked Garth on sight conservative clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and firm Youngish man on the make Madden labeled him and was ready to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions that Mrs. Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer that there were three children two boys and a girl that she was active in the Woman's Club and he in Lions Rotary and Jaycee and finally that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day
Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth
Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it
Madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement He asked to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker's will
Garth brought one out
The date October 8 1957 immediately caught the inspector's eye Fairly recent he remarked Was she in the habit of making new wills
Oh no She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death Her estate had grown considerably She wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most particularly the scholarship fund At the time the will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth
Garth hesitated Mr. Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since though Most of them this past year say Even two or three years ago I doubt that have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair have consulted us you see She always did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised
The inspector nodded doubting this Mrs. Meeker struck him as ready to seek anyone's advice least of all Garth's With her sharp tongue have cut his pompousness to ribbons It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs
Madden settled back to read the will
He skimmed over the millions that went to Meeker Park Medfield Hospital the civic center the Public Health Nursing Association the library and so on pausing when he came to the scholarship fund Two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker's lifetime and the proviso made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail
A splendid vote of confidence in Thayer Madden reflected Tenure too Very nice for him
He went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him Twenty-five thousand to each of the great-nieces in Oregon not much to blood relatives out of millions ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another to Brian Thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars to the Pecks ten thousand each to Joan Sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in Mrs. Meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death No additional five thousand for each year after Joan's twenty-first birthday Mrs. Meeker got around to taking care of that
Too bad Madden thought Joan Sheldon had earned the larger bequest
Mr. Hohlbein was left twenty thousand Garth ten There were no other names Madden recognized Arthur Williams's might well have been included he felt Mrs. Meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers
Madden took up this point with Garth who shrugged it off Old people have their idiosyncrasies
This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more
Well she had a number of them where money was concerned Garth said Sometimes have trouble persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions and known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet the next moment put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston affair There was no telling how react to spending money
Madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund
There was an annual audit Garth informed him No discrepancies or shortages had ever been found Brian Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator His salary had reached the ten thousand mark His expenses ran another four or five thousand The lawyer know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party Thayer like himself Madden reflected was the extra man so prized by hostesses and found him easy enough to talk to But he play golf seem to belong to any local clubs his work took him away a lot of course which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself
Garth's glance began to flicker to his watch
He said that he had already told the police chief that he know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs. Meeker He would offer no theory to account for her murder The whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug
No doubt Mrs. Meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing Even so Madden's dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened It would be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud with its probable by-product of murder led to Garth's door Motive Ten-thousand-dollar bequest At first glance not much of a motive for a man of his standing but for all his air of affluence who could tell what his private financial picture was
The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking Nevertheless he made a mental note to look into Garth's financial background
Brian Thayer had a downtown address He lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business district
He occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second bedroom as his office Airy and bright the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture rugs and draperies Done by a professional decorator Madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable as its occupant In Dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month in Medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it paid by Thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account
He took Madden into the room he used as an office It contained a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs A newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them Thayer folded it up and offered a drink
The inspector declined To begin the interview he asked if Thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston
Thayer shook his head all I think about too That and her death still unbelievable that it was murder For all her domineering ways I conceive of her having had a deadly enemy

Dammit Phil are you trying to wreck my career Because what doing wrecking it wrecking it wrecking it Griffith had confronted Hoag on the building's front steps Hoag had been permitted no further and backed him against a wrought-iron railing His rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed
Hoag said I send for you Leigh I want the captain in charge Where is he
Phil for God's sake go away The in there I told you nothing between Midge and me nothing all in your mind A couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state Why not fit to touch the hem of her garment
Leigh get a grip on yourself not about you or Midge I have some security information about the prime minister
Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes Not about me You mean it Phil You pull my leg old man I did get you on the platform this morning
not pulling your leg Will you call that captain
No use he come He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness What happened to your head
I was hit knocked out Now will you get him
He says to take the message He stared at Hoag drunkenly hit you in the head
It matter You get back to the captain and tell him this going to take a shot at the prime minister and Mahzeer is in on the plot Tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with Mahzeer
Griffith said impossible the ambassador
Nevertheless true
Impossible Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it show you how wrong you are Mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now He nodded triumphantly So that proves it
Hoag looked terrified Where are they
you expect the john Mahzeer's office
Where is that
Facing us two flights up Look old man you go up They even let you in the front door So why you be a good boy and
Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders Listen to me Leigh If you want to spend another day in the State Department another day you get in there and tell that captain what I told you He bit out the words And you know I can do it
Griffith raised placating hands Easy does it Phil I was just going on my way He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back On the second landing he paused to look for Docherty see him and accepted a glass of champagne He took several large swallows recollected that Docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him The way Hoag was no telling what he might say or do He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress Yes what is it He asked
I want Captain Docherty He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him
Docherty said okay Bonfiglio let him by They walked toward each other Well
Griffith said Hoag told me to tell you he waited until they were close it was hideously embarrassing not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer
Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain it would be just like him Why not
He claims in a plot to kill the P.M.
Docherty went taut was it possible Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared Not possible he thought the prime minister knew who his enemy was here he going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter And if by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man he dare try anything now not after Docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well Docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck One more muddleheaded play like that one and be leading him away Still this had to be checked out
your friend Hoag get his information He asked
the faintest Captain
Would you mind sending him up here like to talk to him Troubled he continued along the corridor poking his head into the next office for a careful look around
But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building He was unwilling to rely on Griffith's carrying his message and he had no confidence the police would act on it If Mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street He would have to do something on his own But what
The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps These were the early departures in half an hour the reception would be over If Mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests the scene looked like a Christmas card On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible This would be Mahzeer's office He and the prime minister would be back from the window seated at Mahzeer's desk they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting In a minute or five minutes the business would be done Mahzeer would stand up the prime minister would follow Mahzeer would direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side The single shot would come Hoag would carry its sound to his grave Mahzeer of course would be desolate How was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance
Hoag turned Where across the street Where was Muller waiting with the rifle Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf Most of them could be eliminated Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite The legation was generously set back from the building line if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere Would the shot come from a roof He ran his eye along the roof copings almost at once a figure bulked up But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building if he was here at all and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport
Hoag crossed the narrow street squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk From this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window but he saw no faces the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain If only the latter were true He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades one was a club that was out two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted That left three possibly four one looking much like the next He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule He quickly closed it again He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance
He went on to the next building and found what he expected the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes there were six apartments Now what The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him This was senseless he had no idea what to look for He peered in the boxes themselves all were empty except one and that one was jammed with letters and magazines The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days and not likely to return on a Friday Had Muller made the same deduction Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes
He opened the inner door the cooking odors were stronger all over the city at this hour housewives would be fussing over stoves He climbed as quickly as he could urge his body up the two unbroken flights to the third floor pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade all that remained of the building's beauty He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead Now he was certain the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open It had been shut again but the lock was broken he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch
What was he to do now He had thought no further than finding Muller He realized now he had more than half hoped he find him that Muller would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag's control He could not break in on an armed man He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop Was there time
His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door Hoag pushed open the door at the far end of the long dark room Muller was faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill He turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight dismissing Hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at Hoag's apartment
Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch evil flourishes in the dark The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came Muller nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table his face wore a look of outrage A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain a following volley of shots shattered glass ripped the ceiling and sent him lurching heavily from the table He was dead before his body made contact with the floor Hoag stumbled back into the hall leaned against the wall and started to retch
After Captain Docherty sent Arleigh Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne

The safe at Ingleside District Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain Harris's office to the left the lieutenant's office farther along and to the left and the janitor's supply closet straight ahead
The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold Policemen's Ball tickets from last year and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps Gun set the captain's fifth of Hiram Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt. Killpath though he knew that Killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman Wolff's gift It was more a matter of tact and also it was none of Killpath's goddam business
He walked up to the lieutenant's office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy Range He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes
the Lieut
The clerk wagged his head toward the captain's office Gun went to the connecting door which was open and stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair
The lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded and as Killpath raked the comb through it it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull The lieutenant eyed Gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his head
Leave me alone Gun thought Fight with Sam Schaeffer fight with the whole damned Bureau But leave me alone Because looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man and going to get him If you just leave me to hell alone Lieutenant
Killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced
Gun waited for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window He sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair The desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons
Killpath pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut It was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer He put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant
Gun waited
The 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut closing in the assembled day watch
Finally Orville intoned through his hawk nose We have people running in any time they please Sergeant
No sir Running in running out have it Makes for confusion and congestion He rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach his beady eyes fixed on Matson
He was silent again possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom Roll was being called Gun cleared his throat
Killpath said You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago Sergeant not getting all the juice out of the orange now is it
No sir
Then Killpath smiled Gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time
The day-watch platoon commander Lt. Rinker was calling out the beat assignments but Matson make the names mean anything
I called the station at three this morning Killpath's nasal voice pronounced Do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time
Sergeant Vaughn sir
Now now just guessing Sergeant He smiled thinly savoring his joke What if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen
Sir Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief He must have
He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper Now not regulation is it
No sir
But you know a thing about it did you Killpath leaned forward his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again frowning now not taking one's command with a responsible attitude Matson
Gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank
I was out in the district sir
Oh yes So I have heard He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk I might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped He took up a white sheet of paper dark with single-spaced data
A car pulled into the driveway outside the window Gun knew it was Car 12 the wagon returned from delivering Ingleside's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City Jail But for some fool reason he remember which men put on the transfer detail He stared at the report in Killpath's hand sure it was written by Accacia just as sure as if submitted it in his scrawled longhand He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six he leaned back and peeled off his glasses failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered What have you to say to that Sergeant Killpath sailed the paper across the desk but Matson pick it up or even glance at it
Well
I think Accacia knew so many big words Lieutenant
Killpath licked his lips Patrolman Accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer I think his diligence mitigates your negligence Matson
Negligence hell Gun held his breath a moment pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat Sir I would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot if sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district too bad I call you and too bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when he could have had a boy be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure But not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around and
not push our patience beyond the danger line Sergeant Killpath nasaled I like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty
Gun stiffened his hands balling into fists at his sides He clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out An argument with Orville Torrence Killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range
Killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee just remember Sergeant that we must all carry our own umbrella A district station run smoothly unless He interrupted himself looking around Gun at the doorway Morning Lieutenant Rinker
Sorry Orville I thought you come in yet
been here for some time He stood up cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly The sergeant is just leaving
It had come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers work that Loren Severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes It was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath's office
Now as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out
Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about Killpath's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders He just want to talk about it If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour because be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain
At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes remembering then that left them at the Doughnuttery He could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going home But even before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station he knew that he going home
Not yet
It was nine o'clock in the morning the hour which like a spade turning clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night Mission Street at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty the neighborhood that had known Urbano Quintana by day
Then Sol Phillips had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart seventeen years ago It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foot-high letters across each of the two display windows
On the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was Gonzalez Prop. and under that Se Habla Espanol Mr. Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez Prop. but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome Language was no problem anyway Mr. Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission Street
Aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising Mr. Phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to Gun Matson who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed mauve velour $79.89 nothing-down special
honest as the day Mr. Phillips said and added Mr. Gunnar I can say this to you Beebe is a little too honest You tell a customer how much going to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down A time plan is a mere convenience you understand and when He interrupted himself smiling I put her in lamps That way I lose so much
Why you just hire somebody else

She says she has to finish a story He shrugged I asked her why she do it tomorrow but it seems the muse is working good tonight and afraid to let it go
Casey made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man His name was George Needham and he too had come from a good family He was perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave He was always well groomed and well tailored and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university An only child he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke Since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main interest was gambling
All this went through Casey's mind in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all For he had understood that Betty had been engaged to a boy named Barry Jenkins She had grown up with young Jenkins and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice He wanted to ask her about Jenkins now but he knew he do so in Needham's presence And so still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding
Where did you pick him up
Oh known him quite a while She glanced at her companion fondly I George
been after her for years Needham said but never been able to get anywhere until the last few days
The girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched Casey's hand Can I tell you a secret going to get married Do you approve
Casey kept his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about Needham who was eight or ten years older than the girl He wondered whether Needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from Betty's estate to subsidize him None of this showed in his face and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand He made a point of frowning of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor
have to give it some thought he said You want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would you
She made a face at him and then she laughed Of course not
get my references in order Needham said and though he spoke with a smile Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused Stop by any time Casey He stood up and touched the girl's arm Come on darling If really serious about working on that story better take you home
Casey watched them go still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check As he went out he told Freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat and coat from Nancy Parks and put a fifty-cent piece in the slot he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry
A taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours he did not think to look and see if Jerry Burton's car was still there In fact he did not think about Jerry Burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him Only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty did he remember his earlier problem
Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over Burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it Then he was striding across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note
Jack
Look in the wastebasket I knew the only way I could beat you was to play possum but it was a good try kid and I appreciate it
The wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had happened The discarded papers inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct He put the basket down distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself
For another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious and as the thought expanded the implications jarred him It no longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket And that gun was empty
Even before his mind had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver He considered them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution He said The crazy fool half aloud He put the shells on the table as though he could no longer bear to hold them He thought Where the hell could he have gone How can I find him
There was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his imagination out of control He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough He thought of other possibilities none of them satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton Then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly
Yeah he said
Casey
Yeah
Tony Calenda
Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head When he heard Calenda say What about that picture you took this afternoon It still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank Ackerly
What picture He demanded
You took a picture of me at the corner of Washington and Blake about three thirty this afternoon
Who says so
One of my boys
Casey believed that much Calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his boys close at hand
So
With my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I want that picture published
Who says going to be published
I even want it to get around
Under normal circumstances Casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken Even so he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly Right now however he was still too worried about Jerry Burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story Burton had told him to care too much about Tony Calenda His nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice
Look he said I was hired to take a picture I took it all I know about it and all I care
Maybe better tell the guy who hired you what I said
You tell him
All right Calenda said his voice still quiet But I meant what I said Casey If that picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it going to send a couple of my boys around to see you
You do that Casey said Just be sure to send your two best boys Tony
He hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create As soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found Jerry Burton's home number He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon When he was told that no one had seen Burton since then he thought of three other places that were possibilities Each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up
By the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down He had done all he could and that was that And anyway Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk He Casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible He should have stayed here and watched Burton He So he made a mistake So what
He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink Only then did he decide he want one He considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too Finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes He had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again When he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent
Casey You know me but I know you If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can If you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys
Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision For over the years he had received many such calls Some of them came from people who identified themselves Some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past Others because they expected some sort of reward for the information A few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break Only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police Casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time
He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more to reach the corner a block from Columbus Avenue It was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes He did not bother with his radio there would be time for that later but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned
The police car had pulled up behind a small sedan its headlights still on

Slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart out just a little too far Make a 90 degree straight for shore
Poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw Elaine Now He asked
Pretty quick she replied Will you drop the anchor
Poet nodded swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor The rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the Aj
Reverse Elaine said then peered through the loop of the RDF and waved to Poet A second later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor She cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore Nick watched her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor
Poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks The price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously Nick wondered if Elaine had bought them but he said nothing Nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything It seemed as if they were all under a spell There should be an excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years
But instead of chatter there was a null like on the radio direction finder Once in New York he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine They had all been laughing joking when suddenly the engine had failed No one had screamed No one had prayed All had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind whistle over the wings The pilot had been good landed the plane on a small airstrip in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had coasted to a stop everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment
There had been tension in the plane during the silent descent a tension similar to the one now But in the plane there was a concrete reason for it Now at this moment there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe Yet tension existed The same taut-nerved relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat It hung over them like a cloud its arrival as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun
Silently Elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit Poet behind her Nick trailing behind him She threw back a cushion over one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand
Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun Hydraulic He asked
Elaine nodded They are the best She kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion They are the most efficient
And the deadliest Poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness
Why do you need an arsenal Nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon
quite possible more than codfish down there man Poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held the harness for Elaine
A moment later moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins she picked up the gun handed the knife to Poet then rolled off the transom of the boat back first Poet nodded to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion Another moment and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts
For a while Nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from Elaine They remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side Eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back
Clasping his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky There was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean Alfredo certainly must have enjoyed being alone Next to the ocean probably the loneliest spot was the desert If Elaine's uncle had stuck to this desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive
Yet Alfredo wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts And Graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in Las Vegas It was an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the Trinidad But Graham stumbled on it Two to three weeks prior to the charter of the Virginia Graham had been snooping around the San Luis Rey Mission
The small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and Nick raised up to watch it heading south That was a hell of a note he thought A couple even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them If the character flying that thing had gone over San Clemente Island yesterday he would have had an eyeful
Off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a tack toward San Clemente Behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft The fisherman was right in the middle of the Deep Nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla Deep and the Redondo Deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline
Someday geologists had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more La Jolla or Redondo Beach Meanwhile fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers Sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure
Why he wondered had Elaine wanted him along on this trip He skindive he run a boat except on the open sea He stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could see none Strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom Turning on the hi-fi he went back to the cockpit stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music
Elaine and Poet returned together popping up over the transom almost like dolphins breaking water
He sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern Any luck He asked
Poet shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead
right on the edge of the Deep Elaine said Pulling off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water Which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile she added as she swung her legs over the transom Any news
Not a thing He tossed her a towel then repeated the service for Poet Cigarette
Elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness but Poet nodded His feet still hung over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in The fin on his foot caught on the moulding throwing him off balance His forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat
Kee-reist The word hissed distinctly from Poet's lips as he struggled to his feet
Nick's body became rigid Turning slowly he saw Poet in a brilliant glare of horror Poet His face was still creased in pain as he studied the underside of his arm Poet a murderer Turning quickly toward Elaine Nick saw that she too stood in shocked surprise
The sudden silence was too silent Instinctively aware of the charged atmosphere Poet raised his head slowly looking first at Elaine
She had caught the implication of the oath Her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely motionless
And then Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine himself and Poet
Elaine recovered first so quickly that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction Do you need a bandage She asked steadily
Poet rubbed his arm like banging a shin he said his eyes lingered on Nick's face then moved back to Elaine Hurts like hell for a second then it disappears
get some ointment Elaine turned and started toward the companionway But her walk was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear
Nick sensed it So did Poet Springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the spring gun and whirling pointed it toward the cabin At the same instant Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man The gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine At the same instant Elaine screamed wildly the sound ending abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic struggling Poet
The moment the sea closed over Nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic But the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage The wide flippers on Poet's feet gave his legs incredible power driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over Poet was the captured arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying to escape Poet would escape Nick thought grimly because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water But Nick would not let go
The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's forehead bounced painlessly off Nick's chin then disappeared Poet twisted again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank ripping off the skin For a split second Nick relaxed his grip and Poet's slippery body spun completely around before Nick could stop him holding him now from the rear Something flailed at the side of Nick's head as they rolled around and around
Suddenly Poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water not rising not sinking A sharp pain lanced across Nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs joining dozens of others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising into the sky A black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of him spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head The air hose was free The discovery struck Nick like a blow
Desperately Nick flashed one hand up catching Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow At the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece Instinctively he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose At once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden wild exultation
As if this was a signal Poet abruptly began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water Relentlessly Nick held on sucking on the hose inhaling the air that belonged to Poet Poet was not fighting Nick now

Harbor Point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam a rich village but not much for action too many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run manslaughter about seven months ago
Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age Seeing me he said with real surprise Well well we honored Hardly expected the head of County Homicide up for this murder You sure climbed fast Jed Rookie investigator last summer and now Inspector Jed Took me 19 years to become Chief of our three man police force Proves a college education pays off His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth
I guess it helps I said paying no attention to his ribbing
Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop Jed not only young but well you even look like a police officer A runt with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut hell pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law big and tough Man when my 275 pounds and six-four comes along why the same as another badge When I say move a guy moves
worry about my being tough Moore Also far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come had your gassy lecture get to work Who was the murdered woman Mrs. Buck
Widow nice sort of woman Comfortably fixed Ran a fair-sized farm Came to the Harbor as a bride and worry Jed this one is in the bag I know the killer have the only road off the peninsula covered
Yeah passed your road block as I drove in I said sitting on his polished desk Although Bob dressed like a slob he kept a neat office Okay what happened
About nine this morning Mrs. Buck phones me having trouble with one of her farm hands money trouble Colored fellow named Tim Williams only hand she has working for her now Tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from the South last year but Tim and his wife settled here Never had no trouble with him before thought he was a hard worker hustling around to get a full week's work Anyway Julia asks me to
Julia
Come on Inspector look alive Julia Buck the deceased Moore said slipping me his smug idiot-grin again Julia asks me to come out at once But she sound real alarmed you know like there was any immediate danger I got there at 9:47 A.M. found her strangled I would have come sooner if known No doubt about Tim being the killer I have a witness know why the County had to send anybody up here Told them I can handle this
Yeah seems you have a nice package with all the strings tied
collar Tim before night
your witness
Julia had has an old Indian woman cooking for her Nellie Harris Probably the last of the original Island Indians Nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room Swears she recognized his voice that Tim yelled my money and I want it And then rushed out of the house Then she heard Julia phone me Nellie went on with her house work until I found Julia dead And before you say it Nellie near strong enough to have strangled Julia no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck Another fact disappeared on the run But no way off the Point except through my road block Guess you want to see the body have her up the street in Doc Abel's office see it
We walked up Main Street to this big white house then around to the back Being the Harbor's sole doctor Abel was also its Medical Examiner The corpse was on a table covered by a sheet Doc Abel was busy up front with some of his live patients Pulling back the sheet I examined the bruises around Julia Buck's once slender throat Powerful hands had killed her Find any prints
Chief Moore shook his big head seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body Then he said Never noticed it before I mean when she was dressed but for a woman her age Julia had a real fine figure
I dropped the sheet glanced at my watch It was almost one and I had lunch Still I wanted to get this over with had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office I told him I want to go see the Buck house
Sure
Walking back down Main Street I said I saw the Harbor's one squad car at the road block ride out in my car
Naw use mine Moore said opening the door of a sleek white Jaguar roadster As I slid in beside him he said Some heap hey Got a heck of a buy on this dirt cheap
Yeah a real load I told him looking up the street at my battered Ford
Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow There was a garage and a modern barn in the rear all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes Everything shouted gentleman farming the kind of grandfather-father-to-son folding money the Point is known for The fins of a Caddy were sticking out of the garage while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture
Nellie Harris old she was ancient a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune She was also stone deaf in her right ear She calmly repeated what Moore had told me When I asked Why you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was The old gal stared at me with her hard eyes said She call I do the living room last I went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom way I always do in the morning
Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about
Probably wages Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar Years ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security so's I have to be working now Miss Julia threatened to fire me all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her
Did you hear Tim return
No sir Nobody came until Chief Moore
I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil Mrs. Buck have any men friends
Her The wrinkled mouth laughed revealing astonishingly strong white teeth I never see none But then I her social secretary
Was she on friendly terms with other members of her family
have no family around here They had a son killed in the war
I walked into the living room There seem to be any signs of a struggle I told Moore Where does Tim's wife live
take you there Look Jed this is an open and shut case and I have to relieve my men at the road block soon Okay come on
We did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks In late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these Now they were empty except for a cottage across the road
Mrs. Tim Williams was about 21 with skin the color of bitter chocolate and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers she was startlingly pretty The inside of their place was full of new furniture five bucks down and a buck a week stuff but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home
Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened She said she know a thing Tim had left the house at six in the morning as usual She seen him since
Did Mrs. Buck owe him any wages I asked
Well for this week but they due 'till Saturday Listen Mr. Inspector no matter what anybody say my Tim kill that woman Tim is a good man hard working He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby Even if he angry Tim hurt a woman He never in his life took a hand to a woman or
get him soon see what he says Chief Moore cut in
Does your husband have a car I asked
Got us an old station wagon Need it for the job
I asked a silly question no idea where your husband could be now
She shook her head I knew she was lying I stood there staring at her for a moment thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty
Moore said Come on Jed I have to get to my men
On my way out I told her If you should eh just happen to see your husband get him to give himself up get a fair trial Hiding out like this get him anything except more trouble or a bullet
Yes tell him if I see him
We made it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes I tried not to act scared That Jaguar could really barrel along I told Moore I was going to eat get some forms filled out by Doc Abel
Chief Moore said If I see you when I return see you for certain at my road block Inspector
I had a bowl of decent chowder phoned the Doc and he said leave the death statements with his girl in a half hour Lighting my pipe I took a walk The Harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer Even now there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater There was a 34 foot Wheeler with Chief Bob's in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock It a new boat about five years old but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs I asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's He said You bet Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing
I dropped into the doctor's office picked up my forms As I was walking back to the Police Station which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office I saw Mrs. Tim Williams sneaking into the back of my car If she moved gracefully she was clumsy at it
I got into the front seat She was hiding on the floor of the back seat the soft curves of her back and hips rousing lines I drove out of the Harbor turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped I waited a few minutes and she sat up For another moment we talk then she began to weep She mumbled I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim
Maybe I never saw him so anxious before I said lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette Of course it could be because this is his first murder case You know where Tim is you Mrs. Williams
She puffed on the cigarette slowly sitting slumped against the back seat answer

But the police have dropped the case I want you to go to Pearson City and find out why first-hand stuff for your modern crime series Take the same train Diana Beauclerk took and get there at the same time Go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite 1105
Will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime
Why not The police have finished with it Besides the number of the suite been published in any newspaper To the hotel people just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite
Still they may not want to rent it
your headache Once inside keep your eyes open
For what Alec was growing more and more skeptical The police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a fine-tooth comb The hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed it Ten to one even been redecorated
always a chance they may have overlooked something returned the chief betting on that chance Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk Study the topography of the suite Soak up local color Reenact everything Beauclerk did
Try to imagine going to be murdered yourself between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive
Alec smirked Cheerful way to spend an evening A sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face Suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime
The chief's eyes gleamed He spoke softly That is exactly what hoping for After all the murderer is still at large And the key to the suite is still missing
On the train Alec refreshed his memory of the Beauclerk case by reading teletype flimsies spot-news stories about the crime sent out by the Pearson City Star a member of the Syndicate Press
Diana Beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in New York Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson City Daniel Forbes her divorced husband lived there So did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce Kimball and Stacy
She reached Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel Westmore She telephoned the junior partner of her law firm Martin Stacy and asked him to call at her hotel that evening
At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried According to Stacy she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask Forbes for the lump sum Stacy replied that it would bankrupt Forbes who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture
Stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five p.m. She was in good health and spirits but still determined to get the money from Forbes No one saw Stacy leave No other visitor inquired for her that evening
Next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a
Colt revolver in her brain According to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m. Her door was locked and the key was missing So was the gun
When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk Forbes had motive and Stacy had opportunity Find a motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved
The Hotel Westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City and definitely second-rate Alec's first impression of the lobby was gloomy Victorian dignity black walnut and red plush a black and white tiled floor and Persian rugs
He studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary like the room I had the last time
Certainly sir The clerk was young and limp with a tired smile Do you recall the number
It was 1105
The clerk's smile congealed That suite is taken
Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk Opposite the number 1105 stood one word Unoccupied
The clerk's glance followed Alec's We have better rooms vacant now he babbled Larger and more comfortable At the same rate
Alec's face was dark blunt and sulky He always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous He was looking dangerous now He raised his voice Anything wrong with the plumbing in 1105
There was a sudden stillness in the lobby Two women who had been chattering like parrots were struck dumb A man lighting a match for his cigar paused until the flame burned his fingers Even the bellboys on their bench were listening
The clerk's eyes flickered Of course not
Anybody with a contagious disease been in there
No The clerk was almost hysterical just that well 1105 is being redecorated
I believe it Alec leaned on the desk holding the clerk's eyes with his Suppose you tell me the real reason he drawled There might be a story in it
St-story
with the Syndicated Press Feature Service Either I get the story or I get the suite
It was blackmail and the clerk knew it There is no story he piped tremulously Front Show this gentleman to 1105
The stillness persisted as Alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator He could feel eyes on his back He wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly
The corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet A thick crimson carpet muffled every footfall At the end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked Fire Stairs It was a neat setup for murder
The bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105 The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window A few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow languid as falling feathers Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light
The room looked normal and even commonplace There was no hint of a violent struggle now Deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new It had never been stained with blood Table covers and towels were clean ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches The mirror over the bureau was a blank eye round and innocent
Alec played the part of an innocent tourist Is there anything wrong with this room
N-no The boy dropped his eyes
Afraid lose your job if you keep your mouth shut
The boy raised his eyes Listen mister If you want my advice pack up and take the next train back to New York
Were you on duty here two weeks ago
The boy hesitated Then not talking But I spend a night in here for a million bucks
He was in a hurry to get out of the room Alec gave him a tip and let him go
Alone Alec examined the doors There were three one leading to a bathroom one to the hall and one to the room next door which was immovable locked or bolted on the other side Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table It was just quarter of nine
As he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover Not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room but white Women use white face powder nowadays he recalled They used pink tan or cream powder
Alec glanced into the bathroom Blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands It seemed clean now but Alec decided against a bath He crawled into bed and switched off the light
In the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window It winked as steadily as a metronome on off on off In less than five minutes Alec was asleep
He never knew just what woke him Yet suddenly he was wide-awake There was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall
He lay still listening to the silence watching the light Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes midnight According to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m.
Alec heard a faint sound His heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest For the sound was inside the room
He let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily feigning sleep The sound was coming nearer A monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable
When the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared When the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there It stretched to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling That meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light in this case the window
Cautiously Alec tensed his muscles ready to jump The bedsprings betrayed him with a creak The shadow vanished Someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window
Abandoning caution Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch Before he could snap it on a stinging blow caught him in the ribs He lashed out blindly with his right There was a thick squashy crack of fist on flesh
Something hard grazed his knuckles He put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be Rough cloth rasped his fist There was a grunt curiously inarticulate like that of an animal in pain Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped
Alec waited a moment on guard Nothing happened Again he groped for the light switch
The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room On the bare floorboards a man lay face down He had a short heavy powerful body
Alec turned him over and discovered a round lumpy face with narrow slanting eyes a primitive Tartar face from Russia or the Balkans The man's shoes were too pointed his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist
There was a slight bulge under the left armpit a shoulder holster Alec promptly removed the gun He was familiar with this type He had seen it in the lineup at Police Headquarters in New York in Broadway night clubs and Seventh Avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts But he was surprised to meet it here Diana Beauclerk had no connection with the underworld
A professional gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a
Nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road
The man's eyelids fluttered He opened his eyes
What are you doing here Demanded Alec
The man made no reply His eyes were dazed His lips were bruised and swollen where Alec had hit him
Did you kill Diana Beauclerk
Alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response at all
Oh come on snap out of it Or turn you over to the police The silence was getting on Alec's nerves
The man opened his mouth but no words came Only that curious animal grunting Alec had heard during their fight
you speak English
The man opened his mouth wider A forefinger pointed toward his gullet Alec leaned forward to look There were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was mutilated

In good time I shall get to the distressing actuality to Red McIver and Handley Walker to murder and sudden death But you realize I am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones
It was in 1814 that Abraham Wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house on Dogtown Common a desolate place even then He was sharpening his razor Sister said he do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven And she answered I know but I hope never do such a thing Without a tremor God forbid He said and went out and cut his throat in the cave near Granny Day's swamp
What has this to do with the present Much I assure you You must know what gets into people even such as Red and Handley before you can tell what comes out of them They had learned both of them about Abraham Wharf why I beg you not to forget him His ghost is not laid Red and Handley God help them knew the old Dogtown lore and I knew they knew it for told them a lot of it And it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows
Yes gentlemen I am getting to the point to my point You know the facts they are set forth in your own newspapers You want from me the story but a story is about why and then perhaps about how The when you know yesterday morning So what I am trying to tell you is the why that is my point and that concerns the spirit of the matter There is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture look at that mahogany highboy behind you which has a provocative emanation if I may say so Places too have their haunting qualities Even people And my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter When you hold the spirit of a thing then somehow you know the truth you know a fake antique from the real thing And the truth is what come for is it not
Now Dogtown is one of those places that creeps into the marrow as worms get into old wood under the veneer In fact all the folk who lived on the back of Cape Ann they are not just like others a different hall-mark on them There were no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family Just think of old Granther Stannard who pulled the teeth of Dark Younger her real name was Dorcas and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass After that he was never known to run or even walk fast Today Dogtown is the only deserted village in all New England that I know of There it sits a small highland with towns like Gloucester near by but now the most lost and tortured place in the world Those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony character Scientists say it is the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feels that only a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life in them
walk up there later perhaps a mile from here where we sit And not one single dwelling left there though once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred houses I myself have identified about sixty sites from the old maps and registers A fascinating pursuit I assure you Even I can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man It is now a sweep of boulders and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows
your setting and a sinister one Please get that in your reports It accounts for so many things Both Red McIver and Handley Walker lived nearby almost as near as I do Red lived at Lanesville and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half hour's brisk walk Handley lived further on at Pigeon Cove often find one or other of them up around Dogtown sketching They were both painters They were They are What should one say Well anyhow Dogtown Common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only Sunday picnickers still stray up there from time to time Sea-road railroad lack of water killed Dogtown Dead dead as a brass door nail and I sometimes feel like the Sexton for about the last to be even interested
I knew Red and Handley well As I said they were both painters come separately to Gloucester some twenty years ago always been an artists' colony somewhere on Cape Ann and each married here They married cousins Anta and Freya Norberg There are a lot of Scandinavians in this neck of the woods and many still make painted furniture and take steam-baths Pretty girls among them with blonde hair and pert faces Handley married Freya and Red of the red beard married Anta And it was because of an old Norberg inheritance that I got to understand them all so well The quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw but I must tell you about it Oh yes quite sure important because of the Beech Pasture that Why what gave me the feeling gave me as-it-were the spirit the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair
You see besides being custodian of antiquities I am also registrar No I hold with those who live entirely among dead things I know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries where the live wind blows and not from the hull But got to know both below the water-line interests me also As I was saying known all about the old records including the old Norberg deed Some ten years ago that page was torn out I know by whom About five years ago Handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register He was courteous and casual about it as though it were of no consequence always like that in spite of being a big man When you see him notice his habit of fingering I might almost say stroking a large mole with black hairs on it by his right temple A sensual man but very courteous some would say slick Like his glossy black hair Too many outside manners to my taste He is the sort who with an appraising eye would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her A real gentleman I feel would do neither always worn a broad-brimmed hat and noticed in my small study at the Society that he rather smells of cosmetics The next week cousin Red wandered in as casually but curt and untidy Red was small and fine-boned like ivory-inlay He too asked to see the same page When I told him someone had torn it out he shouted By God that damn Handley the sneak And later in the same week they both came together to examine the register Fortunately we were alone in the building so few people nowadays are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days for they began to abuse each other in the foulest language Red thrusting out his tawny beard Handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair They actually bristled Le rouge et le noir Violent men both Red always was morose yet that day the dapper Handley was the louder of the two But for my presence they would have been at each others' throats
During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was from the accusations each hurled at the other The Beech Pasture had suddenly become valuable a fine granite quarry there and coming back for public buildings Both men knew it was in the Norberg family holdings but to which of the cousins did it belong Anta or Freya Fortunately I knew almost exactly what the will had said It began with a preamble of course This explained that the judge of probate of Essex County 1785 or 1786 appointed three free-holders of Gloucester to divide and establish the Norberg estate After the usual Honorable Sirs it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg one lower room on the Western side privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar I can show you the cellar when we go up also one Cow Right and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower namely the Beech Pasture And I remember that the whole of the privileges not counting the Beech Pasture was valued at twenty pounds I wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring coxcombs when I told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives jointly
That battle scene ridiculous as it was remained in my mind A disturbing picture of bad blood to be further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day I saw Handley escorting Anta Red's wife up on Dogtown Common I felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence Not that I intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high and I am a small woman
One other cause of jealousy between them I must tell you Paint Gloomy and unkempt as Red McIver was he was much the better painter I suppose Handley knew it If Red had a show at Gloucester Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in Rockport You may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence By such touches the pattern takes shape You would call these the motives of crime I would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the designs of destiny Yet with all this knowledge I had nothing of substance to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday
One month ago on the 20th of October was the opening of the gunning season in Massachusetts Not much to shoot but there are a few pheasant Rabbits too if you care for them which most of the folk around here the sense to appreciate Any more than they have the sense to eat mussels That was the day Red was said to have gone away Oh yes talked about doing so In fact he often disappeared from time to time off to paint the sea aboard a dragger out from Gloucester Anta his wife never seemed to mind I suppose these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with Cousin Handley Anyhow I surprised early that morning to see Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road No he have his gun which he should have It would have been a good excuse for his being there at all I myself had been up there by seven o'clock after mushrooms since been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as Sandwich glass

what the man had said Haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes He had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing Was the man drunk or crazy or both But his new-found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the man's eyes were still clear
The guy is off his rocker Haney thought to himself and looked away from those eyes Eyes that were clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them Why he noticed it before No the man was not drunk
He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger But of course he remembered now It was blurred after two hours of steady drinking but the occasion of it came back to him The stranger his head seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection
Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have been hit if Phil called out to him a second before His shout had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking on the spur of the moment As a matter of fact he have cared at all if the guy had been hit Actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them
By then the stranger was thanking Haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend So the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record
Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face without saying a word Very suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and went back to his truck
Haney given it much thought at the time Now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word
When the light went their way they went on across the street And when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them
Phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges But he decided he mind company in return for free drinks even though he made good money at his job Phil was like that
Now he wondered if it was worth it having a screwball for company He really take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy When he finally got the coughing under control he realized that Pete all he gave was his first name was still waiting for an answer he even seem to wink as he continued to stare
Haney managed a weak laugh Guess I think of anyone Pete Thanks anyhow
A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows I think you taking me seriously Phil I meant it And everybody has some kind of grudge I might have got hit by that truck if it for you I believe in returning favors do anything for somebody I like It cost you a cent Phil Go ahead and try me
Phil rubbed his forehead wearily He was beginning to feel woolly Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit He really expect anything to come of it and there were a few people
All right he conceded finally if you must know I get along with the landlord He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while taking a bath He says the neighbors complain but I believe it Why they tell me themselves if it bothers them
The man closed his eyes and nodded When he looked up again he seemed almost contented Fine Give me your address It will take a little time I want to study your landlord's habits and movements first You see I always make it look like an accident Maybe suicide if it looks reasonable In that way no trouble for the customer
Haney's eyebrows flew up Customer
Pete smiled modestly my line of work he said
Five minutes later before Haney could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure
Phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table Some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep
The next day Sunday the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before The hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he groaned He went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly landlord on the way he was still alive and scowling as usual as if tenants were a burden in his life Phil shrugged and ignored him
He went back to work Monday By Wednesday the landlord was still alive Of course On Thursday Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly and wished the stranger could do something about her
Coming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building Inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened
The landlord had died Late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection He had apparently been alone Nobody witnessed the fall just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance
Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks He muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator Once inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair
After a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions But after all why should they Still later he finally convinced himself that it was an accident just a coincidence The stranger really had nothing to do with it of course
Haney went to bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord After all the man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off for it Really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor
So you thought I mean what I said The stranger's eyes were large and sad as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings It was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare
However Haney knew it was not a dream He might be very tight but he knew where he was It was the same bar and it was two weeks later Saturday night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual
He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible from any talkative friendly lushes He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water This favorite grievance was not the landlord He had already quite forgotten about him In fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment His real grievance was Lolly
Toward the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him as if they were fellow conspirators He even noticed what was his name Pete he seen him sit down The man was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow
Haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry dark little man He began to wish that he shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy have to start going to some of the other places again
In a low voice almost whispering the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice
Pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody Haney want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble But there was no trouble The guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by Haney's lack of appreciation
To break the uncomfortable silence Haney began to talk In time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly about his wife He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes
When he paused to moisten his throat the stranger broke in But why pay her bills If she runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not just divorce her
Haney scowled That bitch would love a divorce he growled Then get half of everything I have Community property deal you know have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share She can drop dead
Pete nodded understandingly Oh yes Now I see You must understand I been in this state too long I came out here to retire why I why I do a free job now and then You should have told me about her before
Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again Then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain Suppose just suppose this guy was really what he said he was A retired professional killer If he was just a nut no harm was done But if he was the real thing he could do something about Lolly He felt very cunning very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot
No offense intended he said gently But just that well you know The cops suspect a thing and I thought it was a coincidence After all I know you Pete It could have been an accident He shrugged casually But if you say you managed it The stranger was hooked His eyes burned feverishly Yes yes he muttered impatiently Of course it looked like an accident I always work it that way and always at a time when the customer has an alibi Let me prove it Phil I think I can manage one more favor for you He waited eagerly
Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass

About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through C'mon he whispered floor about three feet down so fall I went through and down into pitch darkness He said Jist stay still pull the boards back and then get us a light Jist stay where you are I jist stayed where I was while he fumbled around and then walked away A moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle and I could see
It was a big room empty except for a few things of Pops's at the far end a wooden crate on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an unrolled bindle I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through
I took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket You first I said
He drank and handed it back Nice place I told him Listen I got a buddy I travel with real nice guy named Larry I know where he is right near here Could he join the party and sleep here tonight too both be blowing town tomorrow so we be moving in on you
He hesitated a second looking at the bottle before he said Sure-sure and I reassured him bring a bottle too and get another one or maybe two while out You can work on this one while gone kill it if you want I took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him
His sure-sure was enthusiastic this time He put the bottle down Git over by the window while light an' put th' candle out When yuh come back put it out agin till both inside
Charlie was waiting leaning against a building front Perfect set-up I told him But we got to go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two On the way give you the scoop
On the way I gave him the scoop I bought another pint of sherry and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again I introduced my friend Larry to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable There was still a little not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it and Charlie opened his
I was reminded amusedly by a poem of Kenneth Patchen's called The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves which Patchen himself read on a record against jazz background The poem consisted of only two words the word Wait repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different inflections and then the word Now And a blaring final chord from the jazz group
This was the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves But we could wait all right there was no hurry I said Wait wait to Charlie and he grinned digging the reference heard the record together once
The second bottle passed a few times Pops was taking long ones but not showing the effect yet He seemed as drunk as when first talked to him but no drunker He had a capacity if really been trying to get him dead drunk have had to go out for more wine
About halfway through the second bottle Charlie looked at me across Pops who was sitting between us and asked Now I said Wait and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely Pops was looking toward me and I said Now to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe meanwhile taken from his pocket once It was a lead pipe cinch
There was a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise Out cold if not dead and never known what hit him never known that anything had hit him
I reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat but Charlie said Wait and said it sharply not as in the Patchen bit but as an order so I stopped my hand and looked at him He was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me
We want to know whether dead yet I gauged that blow to be borderline To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill You hit again about twice that hard before we know whether dead or not That way never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice Dig
I dug him I saw his point it made sense I took the piece of pipe from Charlie's hand and used it harder than he had The thunk was louder anyway and I thought I heard bone crack
Charlie said Good boy That did it if mine And never know which All right now give you a hand
We straightened Pops up and I made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat
I nodded to Charlie put him down again the way he was a more natural position We did that
How do you feel Charlie asked me
Cool I told him What do you feel
Nothing Well maybe exaggerating It was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stakes But not talk about it abstractly until out of here Now first question the bottles Shall we take them all with us or leave one
Take them I said If we left one have to wipe it for fingerprints the picture we want to leave for the fuzz whenever the body gets found This happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum If been working on a bottle or a jug have taken it with him
Right And have taken the weapon with him too so we take that Now He looked around been careful about fingerprints How about you
Same There are the boards over the window of course but not painted and too rough to take prints Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge Besides I doubt if the cops will even try dusting They find dead winos every day maybe they even autopsy him for the cause of death
We take a chance on that got to assume decide he was murdered and got to keep the picture consistent Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets do that We did that and found a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change We took the matches they were book matches and once been touched might retain fingerprints and the change
We discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because have no reason to blow it out The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it set fire to the crate when it guttered out A fire have mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner He might not be found for days even weeks otherwise
We went once more over every point then triple-checked Being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger and we picked up by a cop In fact nobody saw us cop or citizen Winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour Which if it matters was one A.M. Less than three hours ago decided in Maxine Wells's pad on Cosmo to commit a trial murder It had gone like clockwork Almost too smoothly I found myself thinking and then told myself that was ridiculous How safe is too safe Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad
An hour later we were back in my unpadded pad killing what had been left of the second pint We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow Also our plans for me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine But we were really going to do it We shook hands on it
We planned ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes tell him everything learned about Seaton's habits and habitat and tell me the score on Radic We made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad Charlie would get there early because he had the key From here on in the less Charlie and I were seen together in public or visited one another's rooms the better
I was dead tired and slept soundly as far as I know dreamlessly
We met at Maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the evening to talk things out Charlie had brought food and decided on no drinks brought along the virgin pint from last night but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking
I talked first telling him everything I knew about Seaton and his house and domestic arrangements I drew diagrams and floor plans he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down He gave me equivalent and even more detailed dope on Radic including diagrams one of the apartment building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself been there several times back when while he and Radic had been friends or at least not enemies
It take us as long as thought it might it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said Well I guess it Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first Or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy or what
Wait a minute Charlie I said One thing we discussed expense money need some at least if only bus fare to the scene of the crime And if as flat broke as I am I think have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work
He sighed All right come clean got a little stashed for a rainy day and I guess this is rainy enough A couple of hundred If you draw the short straw lend you some bread like fifty bucks before I take off to visit my sister in Frisco Then after back another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy
Solid I said I took a deep breath and the plunge In that case not draw go to bat first have to wait till back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with Doris to have her have an alibi for D-night So it be for days or even a week before you could do anything But your friend Manny can go any time
He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder I was hoping say that Willy But I have suggested it Well in that case I take off tomorrow morning for Frisco And in case I brought the money with me
